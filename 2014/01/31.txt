[2014-01-31 01:21:08] lukeis: hiya jlipps
[2014-01-31 01:26:30] jlipps: sup lukeis
[2014-01-31 01:27:22] lukeis: gonna need the latest of selendroid installed in saucelabs soonish :)  (we're using the F5 key for some tests and that was fixed relatively recently)
[2014-01-31 01:27:50] lukeis: i'll see about getting 0.8 released soon ;)
[2014-01-31 01:29:01] lukeis: is there a better way to go about this 'request' ? like would you like me to log a support request?
[2014-01-31 01:54:58] jlipps: lukeis:  best place is to create an appium issue
[2014-01-31 01:55:08] jlipps: saying 'selendroid xx is released, appium should be upgraded'
[2014-01-31 01:55:16] jlipps: so i can get it into appium then get a new release on sauce asap
[2014-01-31 02:18:56] lukeis: cool, sounds good
