[2014-01-31 01:21:08] lukeis: hiya jlipps
[2014-01-31 01:26:30] jlipps: sup lukeis
[2014-01-31 01:27:22] lukeis: gonna need the latest of selendroid installed in saucelabs soonish :)  (we're using the F5 key for some tests and that was fixed relatively recently)
[2014-01-31 01:27:50] lukeis: i'll see about getting 0.8 released soon ;)
[2014-01-31 01:29:01] lukeis: is there a better way to go about this 'request' ? like would you like me to log a support request?
[2014-01-31 01:54:58] jlipps: lukeis:  best place is to create an appium issue
[2014-01-31 01:55:08] jlipps: saying 'selendroid xx is released, appium should be upgraded'
[2014-01-31 01:55:16] jlipps: so i can get it into appium then get a new release on sauce asap
[2014-01-31 02:18:56] lukeis: cool, sounds good

[2014-01-31 15:35:29] simonstewart: I note with interest that the AndroidServlet instantiates handlers using reflection
[2014-01-31 15:35:40] simonstewart: Reflection on Android isn't terribly efficient
[2014-01-31 15:35:56] simonstewart: Any reason not to have stateless handlers and instantiate them in the init method?
[2014-01-31 15:35:59] ddary: hi simonstewart
[2014-01-31 15:36:05] simonstewart: Oh! Hi ddary :)
[2014-01-31 15:36:21] simonstewart: I'm having a bash at hacking in dynamic loading
[2014-01-31 15:36:28] simonstewart: By adding a custom end point
[2014-01-31 15:36:34] ddary: ok
[2014-01-31 15:36:39] ddary: have you seen my mail?
[2014-01-31 15:36:42] simonstewart: Yup
[2014-01-31 15:36:49] ddary: k
[2014-01-31 15:36:53] simonstewart: The DexClassLoader is a key part of this
[2014-01-31 15:37:07] simonstewart: Was thinking of adding two custom end points.
[2014-01-31 15:37:25] simonstewart: The first would allow a user to add a dex to the selendroid classpath on the device
[2014-01-31 15:37:42] simonstewart: The second would specify a URL, HTTP method and handler class to bind
[2014-01-31 15:38:12] ddary: don'T you like the approach of execute script?
[2014-01-31 15:38:38] ddary: the nice thing is, you can just use it and don't need to modify the clients
[2014-01-31 15:38:50] ddary: but it looks like a bit hacky, i know
[2014-01-31 15:38:58] simonstewart: Right. But overloading executeScript makes me feel sad :)
[2014-01-31 15:39:24] simonstewart: And right now I control both ends of the tes
[2014-01-31 15:39:25] simonstewart: t
[2014-01-31 15:39:50] ddary: that is the reason why i put it to the experimental branch..
[2014-01-31 15:40:35] simonstewart: :)
[2014-01-31 15:40:38] simonstewart: I know.
[2014-01-31 15:41:21] simonstewart: These are going to be used for performance tests
[2014-01-31 15:41:29] simonstewart: So what I really want to do is set up the server
[2014-01-31 15:41:40] simonstewart: And then fire things along
[2014-01-31 15:42:00] simonstewart: Any dynamic code in the execution of the test can have an impact on the performance measurements
[2014-01-31 15:42:22] simonstewart: And reflection on android performs like garbage
[2014-01-31 15:42:54] simonstewart: (which is the reason for my query about why we don't bind the handler instances to the mappers at init time)
[2014-01-31 15:43:25] ddary: there is no reason that I'm aware of not to do it
[2014-01-31 15:43:32] simonstewart: k
[2014-01-31 15:43:51] simonstewart: I'll start hacking on that next, then
[2014-01-31 15:43:54] simonstewart: If you're okay with it
[2014-01-31 15:43:57] ddary: k
[2014-01-31 15:44:04] simonstewart: Thank you!
[2014-01-31 15:44:21] ddary: what I don't like is the the selendroid-standalone the createSession method
[2014-01-31 15:45:07] ddary: it has grown over time, that is no excuse, i know, but if I have finished my current task i want to look at that
[2014-01-31 15:45:10] simonstewart: The special-case handling in "BaseServlet.handleResponse()"?
[2014-01-31 15:45:23] ddary: no
[2014-01-31 15:46:16] ddary: https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/blob/master/selendroid-standalone/src/main/java/io/selendroid/server/model/SelendroidStandaloneDriver.java#L243
[2014-01-31 15:47:33] simonstewart: jeepers
[2014-01-31 15:48:33] ddary: it is just 200 lines ;-) but please explain it in all variants in 2 minutesâ€¦ would propably take longer
[2014-01-31 15:51:12] simonstewart: *clears throat*
[2014-01-31 15:51:20] simonstewart: *gives up on that idea*
