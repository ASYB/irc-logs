[2014-01-08 18:20:30] lukeis: biab
[2014-01-08 18:21:06] Gab__: have you ever trie to use selendroid to test a web page on a phisical device (nexus 7)?

[2014-01-08 19:03:32] jlipps: hey lukeis: how do i know which revs of selendroid are stable enough to bring into appium? do you guys tag releases?
[2014-01-08 19:05:36] lukeis: yes, https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/tree/0.7.0
[2014-01-08 19:07:34] freynaud, quitting. (Quit: freynaud)
[2014-01-08 19:08:12] jlipps: also lukeis how do i use this -nowebviewapp thing. do i pass it as a flag to the instrument command, or what?
[2014-01-08 19:08:15] jlipps: thanks
[2014-01-08 19:08:47] lukeis: that's only for running the standalone server
[2014-01-08 19:08:56] lukeis: i assume you're not doing that
[2014-01-08 19:09:03] jlipps: oh right
[2014-01-08 19:09:13] jlipps: yeah we're building it and running it via instrumentation
[2014-01-08 19:09:33] jlipps: just saw "speed things up byâ€¦" and was like "yeah!"
[2014-01-08 19:09:52] lukeis: heh
[2014-01-08 19:10:10] lukeis: standalone server doesn't resign the android-driver app with that option :)
[2014-01-08 19:28:52] jlipps: hey lukeis i'm running my selendroid tests on the testapp 0.7.0.apk. it's failing to find element with id buttonStartWebView, and it didn't used to. did something change in the app?
[2014-01-08 19:29:10] lukeis: i don't think so
[2014-01-08 19:30:20] jlipps: uiautomatorviewer still thinks it's the same
[2014-01-08 19:30:35] lukeis: use selendroid inspector :)
[2014-01-08 19:30:45] jlipps: i dont' have that set up
[2014-01-08 19:31:48] jlipps: lukeis:  also doesn't work finding by name. i can tell it's waiting before responding
[2014-01-08 19:32:06] jlipps: nothing in the logs other than 'find element command using 'name' with selector 'buttonStartWebViewCD'.'
[2014-01-08 19:32:20] jlipps: weird
[2014-01-08 19:43:11] lukeis: implicit waits are enabled by default (to like 5 or something, which I don't necessarily agree with). I have them disabled immediately in our tests
[2014-01-08 19:46:23] jlipps: i set it to 5000ms
[2014-01-08 19:46:35] jlipps: and i sleep before just to be sure
[2014-01-08 19:46:40] jlipps: for some reason it's just not finding that button

[2014-01-08 21:07:25] jlipps: hey lukeis i'm trying to run a test against selendroid standalone. what are the Selendroid caps?
[2014-01-08 21:08:44] lukeis: 'aut'  (get the value from  localhost:5555/wd/hub/status),  and 'androidTarget':'ANDROID17'  (for example)
[2014-01-08 21:09:21] lukeis: there's more, but those are the only ones really required
[2014-01-08 21:12:57] jlipps: ok thanks.
[2014-01-08 21:18:14] jlipps: lukeis:  hmm it worked from the standalone server. but only after it restarted my avd like 5 times
[2014-01-08 21:19:22] lukeis: did it hit timeouts? there's a command line option to extend the timeout for waiting for the emulator to start
[2014-01-08 22:25:10] jlipps: probably. although what i'm more concerned by right now is why the find element command doesn't work from within appium
