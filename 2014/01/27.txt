[2014-01-27 12:22:42] ddary: hi simonstewart
[2014-01-27 12:22:52] simonstewart: Hi ddary
[2014-01-27 12:23:01] ddary: how are you doing?
[2014-01-27 12:23:08] simonstewart: Not bad. Busy :)
[2014-01-27 12:23:14] ddary: :)
[2014-01-27 12:23:31] ddary: do have any features / fixes in the pipeline?
[2014-01-27 12:23:33] simonstewart: My intern has been working hard on allowing selendroid to detect when the AUT crashes
[2014-01-27 12:23:44] simonstewart: We'll land that today
[2014-01-27 12:23:54] ddary: awesome!
[2014-01-27 12:24:02] simonstewart: And I landed the start of the abstraction of how we send events
[2014-01-27 12:24:12] ddary: i talked with luke and we feel ready for a new release
[2014-01-27 12:24:21] ddary: yeah, have seen that
[2014-01-27 12:24:52] simonstewart: We're aiming to increase the speed of tests by reducing the number of "wait until idles"
[2014-01-27 12:24:59] simonstewart: It'll take a while
[2014-01-27 12:25:13] simonstewart: But we'll get there.
[2014-01-27 12:25:24] simonstewart: Some questions about AndroidServlet, if you have time?
[2014-01-27 12:25:36] ddary: with regards to the touch events we have this one open #213
[2014-01-27 12:25:57] ddary: https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/issues/213
[2014-01-27 12:26:13] simonstewart: scrolling is also fairly janky
[2014-01-27 12:26:22] ddary: currently not that much time. After 2pm CET i have time
[2014-01-27 12:26:47] ddary: would that work for you?
[2014-01-27 12:26:53] simonstewart: Sure
[2014-01-27 12:27:46] ddary: ok
[2014-01-27 12:37:27] simonstewart: ddary: just pushed two diffs

[2014-01-27 12:37:38] selendroid-git: selendroid/master f455f2a Simon Stewart: Correct spelling in error message. No logical change.
[2014-01-27 12:37:38] selendroid-git: selendroid/master 46d2ebf Simon Stewart: Correctly capitalize "stackTrace" so that responses now print them out.
[2014-01-27 12:37:38] selendroid-git, leaving. (#selendroid)
[2014-01-27 12:37:43] simonstewart: The second one will mean that exceptions thrown by selendroid will properly contain stack traces.
[2014-01-27 12:37:45] simonstewart: Which is nice
[2014-01-27 12:38:04] ddary: very nice!
[2014-01-27 12:38:14] ddary: will have a look later
[2014-01-27 12:40:31] simonstewart: There's one more change to come

[2014-01-27 18:21:05] *lukeis always worried to see simonstewart touch the code ;)'
[2014-01-27 18:21:20] lukeis: :whobrokeit  ?
[2014-01-27 18:21:21] ddary: lukeis: welcome, I needed that part as well and implemented it already for running it in ci
[2014-01-27 18:21:48] lukeis: ahh, selendroidbot__ doesn't have whobrokeit ;)
[2014-01-27 18:22:03] ddary: yeah, need to update it at some time
[2014-01-27 18:22:26] lukeis: well, at least you could poll ci ;)
[2014-01-27 18:22:43] lukeis: we could probably do that for selenium tooâ€¦ but it would be complicated
[2014-01-27 18:23:56] ddary: the issue is, that our ci server cannot run emulators
[2014-01-27 18:24:26] ddary: i don't know yet the details, but the virtualization platform has some limitations
[2014-01-27 18:24:53] lukeis: wellâ€¦ if we made a deal with the devil, i'm sure we could run them in saucelabs :)
[2014-01-27 18:25:00] ddary: :)
[2014-01-27 18:25:46] lukeis: I'll bring it up with jlipps next time i see him about
[2014-01-27 18:26:09] simonstewart: lukeis: It's okay
[2014-01-27 18:26:30] simonstewart: ddary: I've some questions about AndroidServlet
[2014-01-27 18:27:07] simonstewart: In "handleRequest" it currently takes a StaleElementReferenceException and returns it as a unknown excpetion (type 13)
[2014-01-27 18:27:35] ddary: that sounds wrong, right
[2014-01-27 18:27:37] ddary: ?
[2014-01-27 18:27:42] simonstewart: Yeah. That looks odd
[2014-01-27 18:27:50] simonstewart: But there's a specific check for it
[2014-01-27 18:29:13] ddary: :spec
[2014-01-27 18:30:01] ddary: error code must be 10
[2014-01-27 18:30:36] ddary: I'm fine to change that
[2014-01-27 18:32:08] lukeis: hmm, i appear to have done thatâ€¦ and I don't recall exactly why
[2014-01-27 18:33:01] lukeis: but that is the likely cause of the last test I checked in's failure
[2014-01-27 18:36:57] ddary: going offline now. have a good evening /day!

[2014-01-27 19:42:24] lukeis: what year was AppCrashedException class created? ;)
[2014-01-27 19:42:50] *lukeis always gets a chuckle when people copy / paste the copyright notice'
[2014-01-27 19:44:31] simonstewart: Megh
[2014-01-27 19:44:33] simonstewart: Meh
[2014-01-27 19:44:46] simonstewart: I just ran that change with all the tests at facebook and the selendroid ones
[2014-01-27 19:44:49] simonstewart: I think it's solid
