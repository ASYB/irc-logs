[2014-01-27 12:22:42] ddary: hi simonstewart
[2014-01-27 12:22:52] simonstewart: Hi ddary
[2014-01-27 12:23:01] ddary: how are you doing?
[2014-01-27 12:23:08] simonstewart: Not bad. Busy :)
[2014-01-27 12:23:14] ddary: :)
[2014-01-27 12:23:31] ddary: do have any features / fixes in the pipeline?
[2014-01-27 12:23:33] simonstewart: My intern has been working hard on allowing selendroid to detect when the AUT crashes
[2014-01-27 12:23:44] simonstewart: We'll land that today
[2014-01-27 12:23:54] ddary: awesome!
[2014-01-27 12:24:02] simonstewart: And I landed the start of the abstraction of how we send events
[2014-01-27 12:24:12] ddary: i talked with luke and we feel ready for a new release
[2014-01-27 12:24:21] ddary: yeah, have seen that
[2014-01-27 12:24:52] simonstewart: We're aiming to increase the speed of tests by reducing the number of "wait until idles"
[2014-01-27 12:24:59] simonstewart: It'll take a while
[2014-01-27 12:25:13] simonstewart: But we'll get there.
[2014-01-27 12:25:24] simonstewart: Some questions about AndroidServlet, if you have time?
[2014-01-27 12:25:36] ddary: with regards to the touch events we have this one open #213
[2014-01-27 12:25:57] ddary: https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/issues/213
[2014-01-27 12:26:13] simonstewart: scrolling is also fairly janky
[2014-01-27 12:26:22] ddary: currently not that much time. After 2pm CET i have time
[2014-01-27 12:26:47] ddary: would that work for you?
[2014-01-27 12:26:53] simonstewart: Sure
[2014-01-27 12:27:46] ddary: ok
