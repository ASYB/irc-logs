[2014-01-16 17:50:09] martink_: Hi, I'd like to ask about the reasoning behind sleeping for 500ms after opening an activity. Thank you. https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/blob/master/selendroid-server/src/main/java/io/selendroid/server/model/SelendroidNativeDriver.java#L116
[2014-01-16 17:52:26] lukeis: because when we tried to connect immediate afterwards we would get exceptions and android needed a beat for it to be 'ready' to accept new requests
[2014-01-16 17:52:58] lukeis: i try not to sleep if i can find some mechanism to see if it's ready
[2014-01-16 17:53:40] lukeis: i remember looking and it wouldn't workâ€¦ and when the exception happened (not every time if i recall) the selendroid server would be halted

[2014-01-16 19:09:50] ddary: hi lukeis
[2014-01-16 19:12:07] ddary: do you have an example about how I can rotate a device with the Python bindings?
[2014-01-16 19:16:48] lukeis: driver.orientation = "LANDSCAPE"   I think
[2014-01-16 19:17:16] lukeis: i haven't tested orientation changes with selendroid
[2014-01-16 19:17:30] ddary: ok
[2014-01-16 19:17:50] ddary: yeah, you should not yet be able to test it, it was not there
[2014-01-16 19:17:57] ddary: but i have implemented it today
[2014-01-16 19:18:06] lukeis: cool :)
[2014-01-16 19:18:19] ddary: tried to find it in the python doc, but was not able to find something
[2014-01-16 19:19:18] ddary: the pull requests are looking fine for me, need just to try it out first
[2014-01-16 19:19:34] ddary: he signed the cla, so it can be merged in

[2014-01-16 19:19:37] selendroid-git, leaving. (#selendroid)
[2014-01-16 19:20:24] ddary: good idea to do that!
[2014-01-16 19:21:55] lukeis: huh, there's a bug in pydoc that the orientation setter isn't listed
[2014-01-16 19:22:49] lukeis: clicking on 'source' next to the property one, links to the setter :)
[2014-01-16 19:22:50] lukeis: http://selenium.googlecode.com/git/docs/api/py/webdriver_remote/selenium.webdriver.remote.webdriver.html#selenium.webdriver.remote.webdriver.WebDriver.orientation
[2014-01-16 19:23:40] ddary: driver.orientation works ;-)
[2014-01-16 19:23:47] lukeis: cool
[2014-01-16 19:24:50] ddary: driver.orientation = "LANDSCAPE" as well
[2014-01-16 19:25:37] lukeis: nice, looking forward to it :)
[2014-01-16 19:25:50] ddary: :)
[2014-01-16 19:25:58] lukeis: I had an internal story (low on priority) in my backlog to implement that ;)
[2014-01-16 19:26:23] ddary: I just looked in the protocol and imlemented stuff that is missing and helpful for mobile web testing
[2014-01-16 19:26:32] lukeis: alert handling in webviews is on my more immediate TODO  (after you know, putting together tests for the frame switching)
[2014-01-16 19:27:11] ddary: +1 on alert handling
[2014-01-16 19:27:17] ddary: i thought about that one as well
[2014-01-16 19:27:25] lukeis: it'll actually be relatively easy to do :)
[2014-01-16 19:27:37] ddary: but will look next week on CI topic
[2014-01-16 19:27:56] ddary: I want to have our ci be able to run as well emulators
[2014-01-16 19:28:42] lukeis: i saw julian harty demo how to run an android emulator on travis-ci and then run (the old) android driver
[2014-01-16 19:30:24] ddary: to be honest I did not made that good experiences with Travis CI and android emulators
[2014-01-16 19:30:34] lukeis: https://github.com/julianharty/android-webdriver-vm-demo/blob/master/.travis.yml
[2014-01-16 19:30:56] ddary: because you had to download, at least in the past, always the android sdk, it was a bit slow
[2014-01-16 19:31:00] lukeis: yep
[2014-01-16 19:31:12] lukeis: would be ideal to have the CI already have the sdk :)
[2014-01-16 19:31:26] ddary: :)
[2014-01-16 19:31:39] ddary: should contact the travis guys
[2014-01-16 19:35:06] lukeis: and I hope you pardon me if I get a bit snippy with the users on the mailing lists when they AREN'T EVEN READING THE ERROR MESSAGEâ€¦. this is why i stopped responding on the Se Users list
[2014-01-16 19:38:50] ddary: I understand you totally. the best thing was #224
[2014-01-16 19:39:15] ddary: it is fine that you have an error, but please tell me your problem and a log ;-)
[2014-01-16 19:44:04] ddary: going offline now, I'm not happy with rotation, that works currently only on activity basis. so is fine for androiddriver, but not for app testing. will have a look tomorrow.
