[2014-01-09 16:11:38] nirvdrum: Glad I asked.  Now that I have, I figured it out.
[2014-01-09 16:11:45] nirvdrum: The jarsigner path was wrong.
[2014-01-09 16:55:57] nirvdrum: Argh.  Now adb has problems.

[2014-01-09 17:37:48] ddary: thanks, how can i help you?
[2014-01-09 17:37:49] simonstewart: I have an intern coming to help with selendroid
[2014-01-09 17:37:58] simonstewart: And he's running into some problems getting the tests to run
[2014-01-09 17:37:59] ddary: sounds good
[2014-01-09 17:38:15] ddary: ok
[2014-01-09 17:38:19] simonstewart: His starter project will be to add crash detection to selendroid
[2014-01-09 17:38:26] simonstewart: So we can tell when the AUT falls ober
[2014-01-09 17:38:28] simonstewart: over

[2014-01-09 17:39:02] simonstewart: oskoryk, meet ddary
[2014-01-09 17:39:03] ddary: hi oskoryk
[2014-01-09 17:39:20] simonstewart: ddary is the creator of selendroid
[2014-01-09 17:39:33] ddary: oskoryk: what platform are you currently running the tests?
[2014-01-09 17:39:52] simonstewart: If it helps, another person here ran the tests and they failed
[2014-01-09 17:39:59] simonstewart: Hmmmâ€¦ maybe I should have a crack at them too
[2014-01-09 17:40:39] ddary: on my local machine i have downgraded webbit
[2014-01-09 17:40:49] ddary: it seems to work better on windows
[2014-01-09 17:41:47] oskoryk: Hi
[2014-01-09 17:44:11] oskoryk: I'm trying to run tests as it described on http://selendroid.io/architecture.html#buildIt
[2014-01-09 17:44:13] lukeis, joining. (#selendroid)
[2014-01-09 17:45:20] ddary: have seen that the capabilities for the test are a bit out dated: https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/blob/master/selendroid-test-app/src/test/java/io/selendroid/support/BaseAndroidTest.java#L74
[2014-01-09 17:45:50] oskoryk: I'm using Mac Os X 10.9.1, Android-19 if it matters
[2014-01-09 17:45:53] simonstewart: Oh wow
[2014-01-09 17:48:48] oskoryk: First of all, we've found that without "adb forward tcp:38080 tcp:8080" it doesn't work at all (not ... tcp:8080 tcp:8080 as it stated)
[2014-01-09 17:51:31] lukeis: that's correctâ€¦ doc error :)
[2014-01-09 17:52:34] ddary: it depends :)
[2014-01-09 17:53:11] ddary: from the selendroid-server perspective, if you test only that part, the default port it 8080
[2014-01-09 17:53:11] lukeis: suppose it does ;)
[2014-01-09 17:54:05] lukeis: oskoryk: are you with simon in London? or somewhere else in the world?

[2014-01-09 17:55:38] ddary: oskoryk: that should solve the base issue
[2014-01-09 17:55:52] oskoryk: here is what I get running the native tests: http://paste.ubuntu.com/6721736/
[2014-01-09 17:55:53] ddary: and of course also from my side: welcome to the project

[2014-01-09 18:04:40] ddary: oskoryk: I executed the two failing tests in the NativeChildElementFindingTest and they are passing if I executed them manually
[2014-01-09 18:05:06] nirvdrum: Cool.  I guess my problem was my avd had a bad snapshot or something.
[2014-01-09 18:10:03] oskoryk: ddary: I've applied your patch, if it supposed to change something
[2014-01-09 18:10:38] oskoryk: I'm executing steps from http://selendroid.io/architecture.html exactly as they are
[2014-01-09 18:11:24] oskoryk: with one more action: I'm also doing "adb forward tcp:38080 tcp:8080"
[2014-01-09 18:12:12] oskoryk: and I still have the same output running "mvn install -DskipTests=false -DtestngGroups=native"
[2014-01-09 18:13:47] ddary: after my change you have to execute;
[2014-01-09 18:13:57] ddary: adb forward tcp:8080 tcp:8080
[2014-01-09 18:14:28] lukeis: he corrected the code to match the docs ;)
[2014-01-09 18:18:44] oskoryk: there is still a usage of 38080 port here: https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/blob/master/selendroid-standalone/src/main/java/io/selendroid/server/model/SelendroidStandaloneDriver.java#L72

[2014-01-09 18:50:51] jlipps: it works on 4.2 / 4.3, but not on 4.4
[2014-01-09 18:51:00] lukeis: ah, kitkat only issue?
[2014-01-09 18:51:13] jlipps: yeah, no clue as to why
[2014-01-09 18:51:22] lukeis: feel free to create a new selendroid issue :)
[2014-01-09 18:51:36] jlipps: lukeis:  IIRC it worked via selendroid standalone though
[2014-01-09 18:51:47] lukeis: ah, then truly odd
[2014-01-09 18:52:00] jlipps: i'll try it again to make sure selendroid standalone wasn't actually using a different emu

[2014-01-09 19:00:05] simonstewart: Oh. hahahaha. Building the android app gives: com.android.sdklib.build.ApkCreationException: Debug Certificate expired on 1/1/14 8:53 PM
[2014-01-09 19:01:00] lukeis: that's your debug certificate then?
[2014-01-09 19:01:29] simonstewart: Apparently.
[2014-01-09 19:01:36] simonstewart: Sorting it out
[2014-01-09 19:01:58] lukeis: rm ~/.android/debug.keystore    and rebuild
[2014-01-09 19:02:07] simonstewart: thats what i did :)
[2014-01-09 19:02:15] simonstewart: great minds :)
[2014-01-09 19:03:21] lukeis: what was fun to come up with a solution is running selendroid on dev boxes that haven't built an android project (and thus don't have a debug cert)
[2014-01-09 19:06:19] ddary, joining. (#selendroid)
[2014-01-09 19:06:26] lukeis: (I create a small temp project and 'build' it and then delete it...)  now I should take into account the debug cert expiring :-/
[2014-01-09 19:06:50] simonstewart: why not check a debug cert into your repo?
[2014-01-09 19:07:11] lukeis: hmm, that would be smart ;)

[2014-01-09 19:09:11] ddary: yes
[2014-01-09 19:09:11] lukeis: (not that anyone's really using thatâ€¦)
[2014-01-09 19:09:27] simonstewart: Hmmmâ€¦ perhaps testing on the KitKat image isn't smart
[2014-01-09 19:09:28] ddary: i tested also on 10
[2014-01-09 19:09:31] simonstewart: Lemme try 4.3
