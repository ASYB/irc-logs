[2014-01-09 17:37:48] ddary: thanks, how can i help you?
[2014-01-09 17:37:49] simonstewart: I have an intern coming to help with selendroid
[2014-01-09 17:37:58] simonstewart: And he's running into some problems getting the tests to run
[2014-01-09 17:37:59] ddary: sounds good
[2014-01-09 17:38:15] ddary: ok
[2014-01-09 17:38:19] simonstewart: His starter project will be to add crash detection to selendroid
[2014-01-09 17:38:26] simonstewart: So we can tell when the AUT falls ober

[2014-01-09 17:39:02] simonstewart: oskoryk, meet ddary
[2014-01-09 17:39:03] ddary: hi oskoryk
[2014-01-09 17:39:20] simonstewart: ddary is the creator of selendroid
[2014-01-09 17:39:33] ddary: oskoryk: what platform are you currently running the tests?
[2014-01-09 17:39:52] simonstewart: If it helps, another person here ran the tests and they failed
[2014-01-09 17:39:59] simonstewart: Hmmmâ€¦ maybe I should have a crack at them too
[2014-01-09 17:40:39] ddary: on my local machine i have downgraded webbit
[2014-01-09 17:40:49] ddary: it seems to work better on windows
[2014-01-09 17:41:47] oskoryk: Hi
[2014-01-09 17:44:11] oskoryk: I'm trying to run tests as it described on http://selendroid.io/architecture.html#buildIt
[2014-01-09 17:44:13] lukeis, joining. (#selendroid)
[2014-01-09 17:45:20] ddary: have seen that the capabilities for the test are a bit out dated: https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/blob/master/selendroid-test-app/src/test/java/io/selendroid/support/BaseAndroidTest.java#L74
[2014-01-09 17:45:50] oskoryk: I'm using Mac Os X 10.9.1, Android-19 if it matters
[2014-01-09 17:45:53] simonstewart: Oh wow
[2014-01-09 17:48:48] oskoryk: First of all, we've found that without "adb forward tcp:38080 tcp:8080" it doesn't work at all (not ... tcp:8080 tcp:8080 as it stated)
[2014-01-09 17:51:31] lukeis: that's correctâ€¦ doc error :)
[2014-01-09 17:52:34] ddary: it depends :)
[2014-01-09 17:53:11] ddary: from the selendroid-server perspective, if you test only that part, the default port it 8080
[2014-01-09 17:53:11] lukeis: suppose it does ;)
[2014-01-09 17:54:05] lukeis: oskoryk: are you with simon in London? or somewhere else in the world?

[2014-01-09 18:05:06] nirvdrum: Cool.  I guess my problem was my avd had a bad snapshot or something.
[2014-01-09 18:10:03] oskoryk: ddary: I've applied your patch, if it supposed to change something
[2014-01-09 18:10:38] oskoryk: I'm executing steps from http://selendroid.io/architecture.html exactly as they are
[2014-01-09 18:11:24] oskoryk: with one more action: I'm also doing "adb forward tcp:38080 tcp:8080"
[2014-01-09 18:12:12] oskoryk: and I still have the same output running "mvn install -DskipTests=false -DtestngGroups=native"
[2014-01-09 18:13:47] ddary: after my change you have to execute;
[2014-01-09 18:13:57] ddary: adb forward tcp:8080 tcp:8080
[2014-01-09 18:14:28] lukeis: he corrected the code to match the docs ;)
[2014-01-09 18:18:44] oskoryk: there is still a usage of 38080 port here: https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/blob/master/selendroid-standalone/src/main/java/io/selendroid/server/model/SelendroidStandaloneDriver.java#L72

[2014-01-09 18:50:51] jlipps: it works on 4.2 / 4.3, but not on 4.4
[2014-01-09 18:51:00] lukeis: ah, kitkat only issue?
[2014-01-09 18:51:13] jlipps: yeah, no clue as to why
[2014-01-09 18:51:22] lukeis: feel free to create a new selendroid issue :)
[2014-01-09 18:51:36] jlipps: lukeis:  IIRC it worked via selendroid standalone though
[2014-01-09 18:51:47] lukeis: ah, then truly odd
[2014-01-09 18:52:00] jlipps: i'll try it again to make sure selendroid standalone wasn't actually using a different emu

[2014-01-09 19:00:05] simonstewart: Oh. hahahaha. Building the android app gives: com.android.sdklib.build.ApkCreationException: Debug Certificate expired on 1/1/14 8:53 PM
[2014-01-09 19:01:00] lukeis: that's your debug certificate then?
[2014-01-09 19:01:29] simonstewart: Apparently.
[2014-01-09 19:01:36] simonstewart: Sorting it out
[2014-01-09 19:01:58] lukeis: rm ~/.android/debug.keystore    and rebuild
[2014-01-09 19:02:07] simonstewart: thats what i did :)
[2014-01-09 19:02:15] simonstewart: great minds :)
[2014-01-09 19:03:21] lukeis: what was fun to come up with a solution is running selendroid on dev boxes that haven't built an android project (and thus don't have a debug cert)
[2014-01-09 19:06:19] ddary, joining. (#selendroid)
[2014-01-09 19:06:26] lukeis: (I create a small temp project and 'build' it and then delete it...)  now I should take into account the debug cert expiring :-/
[2014-01-09 19:06:50] simonstewart: why not check a debug cert into your repo?
[2014-01-09 19:07:11] lukeis: hmm, that would be smart ;)

[2014-01-09 19:08:41] ddary: simonstewart: i have tested mainly in the past on ANDROID16
[2014-01-09 19:09:00] lukeis: selendroid does support down to 10 though, right? :)
[2014-01-09 19:09:11] ddary: yes
[2014-01-09 19:09:11] lukeis: (not that anyone's really using thatâ€¦)
[2014-01-09 19:09:27] simonstewart: Hmmmâ€¦ perhaps testing on the KitKat image isn't smart
[2014-01-09 19:09:28] ddary: i tested also on 10
[2014-01-09 19:09:31] simonstewart: Lemme try 4.3
[2014-01-09 19:11:04] ddary: oskoryk: when the selendroid-standalone server is installing and starting the selendroid-server on the device the port 38080 is used
[2014-01-09 19:11:38] lukeis: i had a perf engineer tell me that UI Automator works in webviewsâ€¦ he was *convinced* it did all the way down to 16, despite my refutalâ€¦ turns out he was only trying against kitkat ;)
[2014-01-09 19:12:12] ddary: oskoryk: but for just running the tests against the selendroid-server, that actually does the job if interacting with the app, it is just 8080, forwarding the port from the device 1:1

[2014-01-09 19:16:39] lukeis: heh, that's Herr Daryâ€¦ or just dominik ;)
[2014-01-09 19:19:10] mummana: i n ur html page u have mentioned "selendroid-grid-plugin-0.7.0.jar:selenium-server-standalone-2.38.0.jar" instead of that u have to use "selendroid-grid-plugin-0.7.0.jar;selenium-server-standalone-2.38.0.jar"
[2014-01-09 19:20:51] lukeis: semi-colon instead of colon?
[2014-01-09 19:20:56] lukeis: which page?
[2014-01-09 19:21:19] lukeis: got it..
[2014-01-09 19:21:50] mummana: http://selendroid.io/scale.html
[2014-01-09 19:21:55] mummana: yes
[2014-01-09 19:22:20] mummana: i used colon and was getting error as class cannot be loaded
[2014-01-09 19:22:27] mummana: when i used semi colon
[2014-01-09 19:22:48] mummana: grid launched successfully
[2014-01-09 19:24:02] mummana: please somebody look at that isssue once
[2014-01-09 19:24:39] ddary: hi mummana
[2014-01-09 19:24:49] mummana: yea hie dary
[2014-01-09 19:24:53] mummana: :)
[2014-01-09 19:25:02] ddary: maybe it is specific thing on windows
[2014-01-09 19:25:08] mummana: i n ur html page u have mentioned "selendroid-grid-plugin-0.7.0.jar:selenium-server-standalone-2.38.0.jar" instead of that u have to use "selendroid-grid-plugin-0.7.0.jar;selenium-server-standalone-2.38.0.jar"
[2014-01-09 19:25:24] ddary: i used it as described on mac and if i remember correct also on linux
[2014-01-09 19:25:41] ddary: and there with that syntax it worked fine
[2014-01-09 19:25:55] mummana: if u look at this https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/issues/208 the guy has used semi colon instead od colon
[2014-01-09 19:26:37] mummana: and for him grid got successfully launched in windows 7
[2014-01-09 19:29:37] mummana: anybody looking at this problem?

[2014-01-09 19:37:40] mummana: jusz a small doubt
[2014-01-09 19:37:48] mummana: wen will be selenium 3
[2014-01-09 19:37:55] mummana: will be releasing?
[2014-01-09 19:40:30] simonstewart: I need to post about that. short answer: when it's ready
[2014-01-09 19:40:50] simonstewart: We're an OSS project run by volunteers. It's worked on when people have the capacity to work on it
[2014-01-09 19:41:04] lukeis: aka, simonstewart is a slacker ;)
[2014-01-09 19:42:06] lukeis: with a 'team of volunteers' who slack as well :-D
[2014-01-09 19:42:15] mummana: LOL like selenium guys said it will be launched by xmas  but still it hasn't??
[2014-01-09 19:42:28] jlipps: i see that you've contributed a lot to the spec convo lukeis :-)
[2014-01-09 19:42:40] lukeis: yes, immense contributions ;)
[2014-01-09 19:43:31] lukeis: when i get spare moments i like to work on making more things work :)
[2014-01-09 19:43:49] lukeis: (like my current spare moments are being spent getting frame switching to work in selendroid)
[2014-01-09 19:44:09] mummana: haha
[2014-01-09 19:44:23] mummana: well dnt forgt to wek on toast too
[2014-01-09 19:44:28] mummana: work
[2014-01-09 19:44:37] lukeis: not as high on my priority ;)
[2014-01-09 19:45:05] lukeis: work is requesting the ability to turn on / off airplane mode
[2014-01-09 19:45:34] lukeis: jlipps: ^ i'll be adding an endpoint to the spec for that :-D
[2014-01-09 19:46:06] jlipps: lukeis:  a whole endpoint huh
[2014-01-09 19:46:06] lukeis: by spec I mean 'mobile' spec
[2014-01-09 19:46:23] lukeis: yepâ€¦ i give big
[2014-01-09 19:46:30] jlipps: what's wrong with a convenience method - ['swipe up', 'click plane icon']
[2014-01-09 19:46:44] lukeis: that's very iOS specific ;)
[2014-01-09 19:46:50] lukeis: and only iOS7
[2014-01-09 19:47:01] lukeis: (what do I work on?) :)
[2014-01-09 19:47:21] jlipps: so a few different convenience methods
[2014-01-09 19:47:25] jlipps: is it really spec-level?
[2014-01-09 19:47:32] jlipps: anyway, e-mail the list and see what others think!
[2014-01-09 19:48:10] lukeis: well, in selendroid we can't manipulate the OS otherwise
[2014-01-09 19:48:32] lukeis: (there's adb shell commands that can do the toggling)
[2014-01-09 19:49:04] lukeis: and I don't mind just adding it as a custom selendroid endpointâ€¦ like simon did recently with brightness
[2014-01-09 19:49:37] lukeis: but in this case I may need it implemented in appium so I can use it in sauce :)
