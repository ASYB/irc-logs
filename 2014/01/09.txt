[2014-01-09 16:09:43] nirvdrum: I've tried starting selendroid for the first time, using the test app.  I'm getting the following error:
[2014-01-09 16:09:44] nirvdrum: SEVERE: Error occurred while building server: An error occurred while resigning the app 'selendroid-test-app-0.7.0.apk'.
[2014-01-09 16:09:53] nirvdrum: Any thoughts on what I'm doing wrong?
[2014-01-09 16:11:38] nirvdrum: Glad I asked.  Now that I have, I figured it out.
[2014-01-09 16:11:45] nirvdrum: The jarsigner path was wrong.
[2014-01-09 16:55:57] nirvdrum: Argh.  Now adb has problems.

[2014-01-09 17:37:21] ddary: hello
[2014-01-09 17:37:26] ddary: happy new year!
[2014-01-09 17:37:32] simonstewart: Also, happy new year!
[2014-01-09 17:37:48] ddary: thanks, how can i help you?
[2014-01-09 17:37:49] simonstewart: I have an intern coming to help with selendroid
[2014-01-09 17:37:58] simonstewart: And he's running into some problems getting the tests to run
[2014-01-09 17:37:59] ddary: sounds good
[2014-01-09 17:38:15] ddary: ok
[2014-01-09 17:38:19] simonstewart: His starter project will be to add crash detection to selendroid
[2014-01-09 17:38:26] simonstewart: So we can tell when the AUT falls ober
[2014-01-09 17:38:28] simonstewart: over

[2014-01-09 17:38:45] simonstewart: Ah! Here he is
[2014-01-09 17:39:02] simonstewart: oskoryk, meet ddary
[2014-01-09 17:39:03] ddary: hi oskoryk
[2014-01-09 17:39:20] simonstewart: ddary is the creator of selendroid
[2014-01-09 17:39:33] ddary: oskoryk: what platform are you currently running the tests?
[2014-01-09 17:39:52] simonstewart: If it helps, another person here ran the tests and they failed
[2014-01-09 17:39:59] simonstewart: Hmmmâ€¦ maybe I should have a crack at them too
[2014-01-09 17:40:39] ddary: on my local machine i have downgraded webbit
[2014-01-09 17:40:49] ddary: it seems to work better on windows
[2014-01-09 17:41:47] oskoryk: Hi
[2014-01-09 17:44:11] oskoryk: I'm trying to run tests as it described on http://selendroid.io/architecture.html#buildIt
[2014-01-09 17:44:13] lukeis, joining. (#selendroid)
[2014-01-09 17:45:20] ddary: have seen that the capabilities for the test are a bit out dated: https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/blob/master/selendroid-test-app/src/test/java/io/selendroid/support/BaseAndroidTest.java#L74
[2014-01-09 17:45:50] oskoryk: I'm using Mac Os X 10.9.1, Android-19 if it matters
[2014-01-09 17:45:53] simonstewart: Oh wow
[2014-01-09 17:48:48] oskoryk: First of all, we've found that without "adb forward tcp:38080 tcp:8080" it doesn't work at all (not ... tcp:8080 tcp:8080 as it stated)
[2014-01-09 17:51:31] lukeis: that's correctâ€¦ doc error :)
[2014-01-09 17:52:34] ddary: it depends :)
[2014-01-09 17:53:11] ddary: from the selendroid-server perspective, if you test only that part, the default port it 8080
[2014-01-09 17:53:11] lukeis: suppose it does ;)
[2014-01-09 17:54:05] lukeis: oskoryk: are you with simon in London? or somewhere else in the world?
[2014-01-09 17:54:10] lukeis: (and welcome to the project ;) )
