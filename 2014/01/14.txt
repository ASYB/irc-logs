[2014-01-14 13:36:16] ddary: :log
[2014-01-14 15:12:34] ddary: hi oskoryk
[2014-01-14 15:34:24] oskoryk: hi
[2014-01-14 15:45:09] ddary: how are you doing?
[2014-01-14 16:57:24] oskoryk: alright, thanks :)
[2014-01-14 16:57:42] oskoryk: yesterday I've made a fork of selendroid
[2014-01-14 16:57:51] ddary: ok
[2014-01-14 16:58:20] oskoryk: and pushed small changes which make 99% test running well on my machine
[2014-01-14 16:58:21] ddary: on my machine currently nearly all the tests are passing on Android16
[2014-01-14 16:58:22] oskoryk: https://github.com/skorknure/selendroid
[2014-01-14 17:00:03] ddary: ok
[2014-01-14 17:00:15] ddary: i currently rename test methods
[2014-01-14 17:00:34] ddary: looks like we will have merging fun
[2014-01-14 17:01:10] ddary: the reason for doing it, names are too long and with the shorter method names it is easier to understand, what is actually tested
[2014-01-14 17:02:55] ddary: On what platform are you testing?
[2014-01-14 17:03:45] oskoryk: on mac os x 10.9.1. For now mostly on Android-17
[2014-01-14 17:04:18] ddary: ok
[2014-01-14 17:04:54] ddary: good to know that you are on a different (Android) platform, then we have a better coverage
[2014-01-14 17:05:19] ddary: with regards to the merge, if there are conflicts, i will take care of it
[2014-01-14 17:05:48] oskoryk: yes. but I tried Android-16 and -19 as well, as far as I remember all issues were about the same
[2014-01-14 17:07:58] ddary: ok
[2014-01-14 17:09:33] oskoryk: what do you think about the following
[2014-01-14 17:09:50] mariusb, joining. (#selendroid)
[2014-01-14 17:09:56] oskoryk: when application which we are trying to test suddenly crashes - we receive "org.openqa.selenium.remote.UnreachableBrowserException: Error communicating with the remote browser. It may have died." exception
[2014-01-14 17:10:27] oskoryk: but it is only one of different cases when we can receive it
[2014-01-14 17:11:06] oskoryk: now I'm thinking about whether it's possible or not to clearly distinguish crashes
[2014-01-14 17:11:32] oskoryk: and as one option to throw specific exception in this case
[2014-01-14 17:12:16] ddary: that sounds good
[2014-01-14 17:12:51] ddary: maybe what you can do is to have a look at the adb logcat and return the error that is displayed there
[2014-01-14 17:14:31] ddary: the logs are here: https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/blob/master/selendroid-standalone/src/main/java/io/selendroid/android/impl/AbstractDevice.java#L319
[2014-01-14 17:14:46] oskoryk: thanks
[2014-01-14 17:18:52] oskoryk: now I'm trying to get better understanding of the codebase. And in parallel thinking about the above problem
[2014-01-14 17:19:29] smccarthy, joining. (#selendroid)
[2014-01-14 17:19:57] oskoryk: if you will suddenly come up with another good approach to do this - please share it with me :)
[2014-01-14 17:21:19] ddary: sure
[2014-01-14 17:21:34] ddary: do you have any specific question about the code base?
[2014-01-14 17:22:00] oskoryk: not yet
[2014-01-14 17:22:37] ddary: this error/crash handler would be also helpful in the process of creating a new session
[2014-01-14 17:23:11] oskoryk: Simon told that Google Espresso framework handles crashes somehow
[2014-01-14 17:23:32] oskoryk: I'm also trying to read their codebase and get some ideas from there
[2014-01-14 17:24:02] ddary: sometimes it happens that the wrong app is installed: what I mean with that is that the selendroid server and the  app under test are not signed with the same certificate. that would be great, if we could handle that as well
[2014-01-14 17:24:37] ddary: yeah, i can remember. Simon said this, but I did not had a chance to look at Espresso
[2014-01-14 17:25:17] *ddary feels good because the new test method names are so easy to understand :)'
[2014-01-14 17:26:45] oskoryk: there is no more testShouldBeAbleTo*** prefix?
[2014-01-14 17:30:22] ddary: it is like:
[2014-01-14 17:30:23] ddary: shouldFindInvisibleElemenByText
[2014-01-14 17:30:53] ddary: beAbleTo is nice but verbose
[2014-01-14 17:31:22] ddary: as well without the "test" word it is shorter, especially in the outline of the IDE

[2014-01-14 18:58:34] lukeis: fine by me :) Everywhere I use selendroid I use `-port 4444`
[2014-01-14 18:58:51] ddary: super
[2014-01-14 18:59:25] ddary: then i need to update the docu in some places, but then it is consistent and easier to use it with python
[2014-01-14 18:59:52] lukeis: true… i'm not sure why python fails when trying to connect on 5555
[2014-01-14 19:00:58] jlipps, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-01-14 19:01:33] ddary: in the past i used something like:
[2014-01-14 19:02:01] ddary: d=webdriver.Remote(command_executor='http://127.0.0.1:5555/wd/hub',desired_capabilities={'aut': 'com.ebay.mobile:2.4.0.23'}) but with the newer versions of the python bindings it was not working anymore
[2014-01-14 19:02:42] lukeis: yeah, something with the keep-alives maybe, i'm not sure
[2014-01-14 19:03:15] ddary: btw: did you have seen I have given you access to google analytics?
[2014-01-14 19:03:22] lukeis: yes, i did :)
[2014-01-14 19:03:46] lukeis: and saw the spike in traffic after Dec. 26 (when I closed all the Selenium issues and linked the project)
