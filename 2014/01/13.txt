[2014-01-13 15:51:33] mwalton: Hello. I'm trying to write some selendroid tests for a native android app, I'm quite impressed with it so far, but I have a question. In between test scenarios I'm like to return to a known state (i.e. return to the apps home screen). Is there a simple way to do this using the selendroid api?
[2014-01-13 15:52:09] ddary: hi mwalton
[2014-01-13 15:52:29] ddary: yes, you can just open the home activity of your app via
[2014-01-13 15:52:58] ddary: driver.get("and-activity://com.your.package.YourMainActivity")
[2014-01-13 15:53:15] mwalton: thanks ddary. I'll give that a shot.
[2014-01-13 15:53:56] ddary: a full example you see here: https://github.com/selendroid/demoproject-selendroid/blob/master/src/main/java/io/selendroid/demo/nativeui/UserRegistrationTest.java#L53

[2014-01-13 20:18:41] julian__: does selendroid accept commands via "execute()"?
[2014-01-13 20:19:16] lukeis: there's a few in 'native' mode, but 'webview' should be just like regular selenium
[2014-01-13 20:20:51] julian__: cool. thanks. can you point me to where i might find a list of them?  my searches come up empty.  maybe i'm not using the correct terms.
[2014-01-13 20:21:27] lukeis: https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/blob/master/selendroid-server/src/main/java/io/selendroid/server/model/DefaultSelendroidDriver.java#L379
[2014-01-13 20:22:00] julian__: awesome! thanks.
[2014-01-13 20:23:01] lukeis: they aren't widely publicized for a reasonâ€¦ they should be avoided as they're not apart of the standard way to extend the selenium protocol
[2014-01-13 20:23:23] julian__: ah. ok.
[2014-01-13 20:23:25] lukeis: (it's a horrible hack that they're there to begin with)
