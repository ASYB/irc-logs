[2014-01-13 15:51:33] mwalton: Hello. I'm trying to write some selendroid tests for a native android app, I'm quite impressed with it so far, but I have a question. In between test scenarios I'm like to return to a known state (i.e. return to the apps home screen). Is there a simple way to do this using the selendroid api?
[2014-01-13 15:52:09] ddary: hi mwalton
[2014-01-13 15:52:29] ddary: yes, you can just open the home activity of your app via
[2014-01-13 15:52:58] ddary: driver.get("and-activity://com.your.package.YourMainActivity")
[2014-01-13 15:53:15] mwalton: thanks ddary. I'll give that a shot.
[2014-01-13 15:53:56] ddary: a full example you see here: https://github.com/selendroid/demoproject-selendroid/blob/master/src/main/java/io/selendroid/demo/nativeui/UserRegistrationTest.java#L53
