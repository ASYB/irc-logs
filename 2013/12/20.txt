[2013-12-20 14:49:38] ddary: because i'm new in python, just wanna ask if you can have a look it this makes sense:

[2013-12-20 19:30:07] ddary: hi lukeis
[2013-12-20 19:30:10] lukeis: (meeting biab)
[2013-12-20 19:30:57] ddary: ok
[2013-12-20 20:15:04] ddary: lukeis: just ping me if you have time
[2013-12-20 20:15:20] lukeis: i do now :)
[2013-12-20 20:16:13] ddary: :)
[2013-12-20 20:16:37] ddary: what is the issue with the tests?
[2013-12-20 20:17:21] lukeis: oh, my local changes broke them :)
[2013-12-20 20:17:41] ddary: I see
[2013-12-20 20:19:34] ddary: I started today to work on the mobile test part:
[2013-12-20 20:19:35] ddary: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/list?repo=mobile
[2013-12-20 20:20:05] ddary: the API demo app can now also display the selenium html test files
[2013-12-20 20:20:52] ddary: and wrote the first python test: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/test/webdriver/mobile/webview/find_element_tests.py?repo=mobile
[2013-12-20 20:22:52] ddary: like it so far:)

[2013-12-20 20:39:26] jlipps: what's up?
[2013-12-20 20:39:48] ddary: I finally had time to add the web view do the apiDemos app and added as well the first test
[2013-12-20 20:40:09] ddary: still need to add more stuff, but at least the first stuff is there
[2013-12-20 20:40:52] ddary: what was the part that you wanted to add to that App?

[2013-12-20 21:57:16] jack090_: lukeis I never did find a good com.android.chrome.pak
[2013-12-20 21:57:17] jack090_: apk
[2013-12-20 21:57:28] jack090_: I guess I should probably just putt it off my device
[2013-12-20 23:24:05] jack090_: lukeis: so I took the chrome.apk from a working nexus 7 on kitkat
[2013-12-20 23:24:09] jack090_: copied it over
[2013-12-20 23:24:18] jack090_: but i'm still having chrome crash when loading up
[2013-12-20 23:24:30] lukeis: :-/  maybe they broke it on emulators?
[2013-12-20 23:24:42] jack090_: I'm thinking they must have
[2013-12-20 23:25:01] jack090_: i tried using browser instead of chrome
[2013-12-20 23:25:12] jack090_: and it barfed on me saying webviews need some sort of activity
[2013-12-20 23:25:21] lukeis: yeah, that won't work :)
[2013-12-20 23:25:21] jack090_: I could use the default browser if it'd work
[2013-12-20 23:25:44] lukeis: i'm very very very close with adding 'AndroidDriver' to selendroid
[2013-12-20 23:25:53] jack090_: :-D
[2013-12-20 23:26:03] lukeis: but not the bits about using chromedriver on API19+
[2013-12-20 23:26:16] lukeis: that'll be the 'next' effort
[2013-12-20 23:26:31] jack090_: don't really care about using chromedriver
[2013-12-20 23:26:32] jack090_: per say
[2013-12-20 23:26:46] jack090_: more or less I need tests to work on android without taking a dive after 4-6 tests
[2013-12-20 23:26:55] jack090_: the webdriver.apk crashes constantly
[2013-12-20 23:27:11] jack090_: I use to use that and would fork the output using socat etc...
[2013-12-20 23:27:20] jack090_: so I could use remotewebdriver
[2013-12-20 23:27:32] jack090_: but webdriver.apk would constantly die after a while
[2013-12-20 23:28:00] lukeis: here's the webview app https://org62.my.salesforce.com/sfc/p/000000000062/a/300000009TLl/8RvKz69Ka6c7U3zRtEOZ.u5JHsr_731a085X1krZSkM=
[2013-12-20 23:28:06] lukeis: use it with selendroid
[2013-12-20 23:28:38] lukeis: java -jar selendroidâ€¦.-with-dependencies.jar  -aut android-driverâ€¦.apk  -port 4444
[2013-12-20 23:29:31] lukeis: only thing 'extra' you need to do after starting the RemoteWebDriver against it is to call driver.switchTo().window("WEBVIEW")
[2013-12-20 23:30:18] jack090_: hrm..
[2013-12-20 23:30:25] jack090_: let me give that a try
[2013-12-20 23:30:42] jack090_: should i use the selendroid gui
[2013-12-20 23:30:47] jack090_: or best w/ command line
[2013-12-20 23:31:43] jack090_: oh wait
[2013-12-20 23:31:47] jack090_: brain fart
[2013-12-20 23:31:47] jack090_: lol
[2013-12-20 23:31:52] jack090_: it's just a jar
