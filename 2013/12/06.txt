[2013-12-06 16:08:07] simonstewart: ddary: what's the recommended way to do TDD for selendroid?
[2013-12-06 16:08:15] simonstewart: If I want to run an actual end to end test?
[2013-12-06 16:08:24] ddary: hi
[2013-12-06 16:08:35] simonstewart: Because I'm fairly sure that my code is technically correct, but may not actually work
[2013-12-06 16:08:48] ddary: http://selendroid.io/architecture.html#testIt
[2013-12-06 16:09:00] ddary: there you have the pointers to the test classes
[2013-12-06 16:09:03] simonstewart: Knew you'd be way ahead of me :)
[2013-12-06 16:09:05] ddary: the end to end ones
[2013-12-06 16:09:40] ddary: currently really an end to end ci job is missing
[2013-12-06 16:09:57] simonstewart: Those are a PITA to set up
[2013-12-06 16:09:59] ddary: i started to work on it at ci.selendroid.io
[2013-12-06 16:10:14] ddary: but i have currently other stuff to do
[2013-12-06 16:11:03] ddary: creating the java atoms will stay part of selenium, right?
[2013-12-06 16:14:51] simonstewart: They will
