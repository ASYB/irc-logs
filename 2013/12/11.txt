[2013-12-11 18:54:01] lukeis: hiya ddary hope all is well :)
[2013-12-11 18:56:39] ddary: hi lukeis
[2013-12-11 18:56:47] ddary: yes everything is fine :)
[2013-12-11 18:57:06] ddary: I'm about to go this evening to the christmas party here in London
[2013-12-11 18:57:23] ddary: met yesterday Simon and his team here as well
[2013-12-11 18:57:43] lukeis: great :) hope that was fruitful :)
[2013-12-11 18:58:29] ddary: indeed
[2013-12-11 18:58:40] ddary: how are you doing?
[2013-12-11 18:59:25] lukeis: well, FINALLY getting to hand off maintaining the android team's tests back to them and get to work on good things ;)
[2013-12-11 18:59:49] ddary: great :-)
[2013-12-11 19:00:27] lukeis: that last commit of mine was long comingâ€¦ i just 'dealt' with not having a screenshot in the inspector for a long time
[2013-12-11 19:02:12] ddary: oh, really? was not aware of it, but it is probably related to that i never use --installedApp
[2013-12-11 19:02:27] lukeis: :)
[2013-12-11 19:02:39] lukeis: only a problem with emulators & installedApp
[2013-12-11 19:02:45] lukeis: real device was fine
[2013-12-11 19:03:10] lukeis: thus not many complaints from the dev team since they hardly use the emulator ;)
[2013-12-11 19:03:40] ddary: good to know
[2013-12-11 19:04:35] ddary: i have mainly used selendroid in the past weeks to identify hardware devices and manage apps on a devcice wall
