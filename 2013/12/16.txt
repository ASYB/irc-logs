[2013-12-16 22:07:40] jack090:  * Deprecated .NET AndroidDriver class. Going forward, the recommended approach    is to use a third-party implementation for Android, such as Selendroid    (http://selendroid.io/) or Appium (http://appium.io/).
[2013-12-16 22:08:06] jack090: lukeis does selendroid support chrome or default browser yet?

[2013-12-16 22:09:39] jack090: saw this on new selenium release: * Deprecated .NET AndroidDriver class. Going forward, the recommended approach    is to use a third-party implementation for Android, such as Selendroid    (http://selendroid.io/) or Appium (http://appium.io/).
[2013-12-16 22:09:42] lukeis1: chromedriver supports chrome
[2013-12-16 22:10:02] lukeis1: i'm working on a simple webview app to get integrated into selendroid
[2013-12-16 22:10:21] jack090: ahh but chromedriver doesn't support anything below kitkat
[2013-12-16 22:10:26] jack090: correct?

[2013-12-16 22:11:23] lukeis2: umm, chromedriver + chrome will work on more than that I think
[2013-12-16 22:11:33] lukeis2: but webview needs kitkat

[2013-12-16 22:12:18] jack090: ChromeDriver supports running tests on Chrome browser (version 30+) as well as WebView-based apps starting in Android 4.4 (KitKat) that have enabled web debugging and JavaScript. You can install Chrome app from:
[2013-12-16 22:12:28] jack090: just read that
[2013-12-16 22:13:24] jack090: so... the problem is kitkat doesn't support x86 emulation yet
[2013-12-16 22:13:29] jack090: at least a few days ago it didn't
[2013-12-16 22:13:32] jack090: hrm...
[2013-12-16 22:14:12] lukeis: no, it doesn't

[2013-12-16 22:14:39] lukeis: i thought my coworker had run chromedriver + chrome.apk on something lower than 19â€¦ maybe 17
[2013-12-16 22:14:55] lukeis: webview, yeah, 19+ only
[2013-12-16 22:14:57] jack090: hrm... I can give it a try
[2013-12-16 22:15:15] jack090: so I can only use testing in kitkat and above?
[2013-12-16 22:15:21] jack090: er.. chromdriver
[2013-12-16 22:15:32] jack090: blah brain dumb today
[2013-12-16 22:21:56] lukeis: yes, although the current version of chromedriver assumes you are only using it to control your app (so, getting to a webview if it's not the first thing you are SOL)
[2013-12-16 22:22:13] *lukeis has a patch that was sumbittedâ€¦ so 2.8 will have a fix for it'
