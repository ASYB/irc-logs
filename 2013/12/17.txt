[2013-12-17 00:00:44] lukeis1: jack090: I'm now seeing an x86 image for API 19
[2013-12-17 00:05:01] jack090: awesome
[2013-12-17 00:05:07] jack090: I'll get myself a copy :-)
[2013-12-17 00:05:14] jack090: thanks for the heads up lukeis1
[2013-12-17 00:05:28] lukeis1, changing nick to lukeis.
[2013-12-17 00:06:19] jack090: so selendroid 2.8 will have the fix to run web?
[2013-12-17 00:06:23] jack090: or chromedriver?
[2013-12-17 00:06:38] lukeis: what's 2.8?
[2013-12-17 00:06:50] jack090: * lukeis has a patch that was sumbittedâ€¦ so 2.8 will have a fix for it
[2013-12-17 00:06:54] lukeis: oh, chromedriver 2.8
[2013-12-17 00:07:00] lukeis: 2.7 is current release
[2013-12-17 00:07:04] jack090: ahhh
[2013-12-17 00:07:08] jack090: gotcha thanks
[2013-12-17 00:07:35] jack090: http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html
[2013-12-17 00:08:00] jack090: it'll be next version or is there a "dev" branch I can compile?
[2013-12-17 00:08:01] lukeis: yep
[2013-12-17 00:08:31] lukeis: you can compile if you checkout *ALL OF CHROME* and then build chromedriverâ€¦. not for the faint of heart
[2013-12-17 00:08:39] jack090: hrm...
[2013-12-17 00:08:43] jack090: I might just wait hehe
[2013-12-17 00:08:43] lukeis: s/chrome/chromium/
[2013-12-17 00:08:57] lukeis: took me 3 days just to figure out how to build it ;)
[2013-12-17 00:09:49] lukeis: of course no one was there to answer my questions and the documentation was hard to followâ€¦. so, I could walk you through it quickly, but the cloning of the source tree will take a while
[2013-12-17 00:10:56] jack090: Yea I'll just wait
[2013-12-17 00:11:05] jack090: so my options to run web on android are:
[2013-12-17 00:11:17] jack090: selendroid Or chromedriver 2.8
[2013-12-17 00:11:33] jack090: but selendroid will require me to create my own webview apk
[2013-12-17 00:11:42] jack090: and "launch" it as an app

[2013-12-17 00:13:09] lukeis: here ya goâ€¦ there's your "own" webview app ;)
[2013-12-17 00:13:21] lukeis: my work is in progress on making this easier
[2013-12-17 00:14:08] lukeis: if you have the source of selendroid, go into that new folder and run `mvn package`  and in target you'll have a new apk for the webview app to run against
[2013-12-17 00:15:09] lukeis: so, one step down for youâ€¦ I'll be following up in the next couple of (days? weeks?) to get it so you can do something like:  new RemoteWebDriver(DesiredCapabilities.android());  and it will load the webview app for you
[2013-12-17 00:15:09] jack090: sweet
[2013-12-17 00:15:49] jack090: http://ios-driver.github.io/ios-driver/building-source.html
[2013-12-17 00:15:55] lukeis: ?
[2013-12-17 00:15:57] jack090: I assume similar instructions for building
[2013-12-17 00:16:14] jack090: (just made that a couple days ago for the ios-driver team)
[2013-12-17 00:16:23] jack090: in case any newbs like me stumble in
[2013-12-17 00:16:26] lukeis: http://selendroid.io/architecture.html
[2013-12-17 00:16:30] lukeis: how to build selendroid section
[2013-12-17 00:16:42] lukeis: oh, that's out of date
[2013-12-17 00:16:46] lukeis: nm
[2013-12-17 00:17:09] lukeis: just clone the project and run  `mvn package -DskipTests=true`   and you have built selendroid
[2013-12-17 00:17:19] jack090: Yea I'll work on that tomorrow
[2013-12-17 00:17:26] jack090: do you want me to update the documentation and push it?
[2013-12-17 00:17:44] lukeis: cd into the android-driver and run that same command and a new folder 'target' will appear and have the webview apk
[2013-12-17 00:17:52] jack090: It's the least I can do :-)
[2013-12-17 00:18:07] lukeis: if you want, i may just update that right now ;)
[2013-12-17 00:18:56] jack090: Well I'm not going to stop you :-)
[2013-12-17 00:19:08] jack090: I'm heading out for the day but I've got it bookmarked.
[2013-12-17 00:19:18] jack090: I'm going to have some time tomorrow to take a look at it

[2013-12-17 17:56:15] lukeis: hiya ddary
[2013-12-17 17:56:27] ddary: hi lukeis
[2013-12-17 17:56:43] ddary: have seen you are working on AndroidDriver
[2013-12-17 17:56:47] lukeis: just wanted to let you know my intensions for android-driver, in case I didn't make it clear :)
[2013-12-17 17:56:51] lukeis: yeah
[2013-12-17 17:57:10] lukeis: I want to have new RemoteWebDriver(DesiredCapabilities.android());  'work' against selendroid
[2013-12-17 17:57:35] lukeis: which will auto-install the android-driver apk and launch it and switch to the webview
[2013-12-17 17:58:02] ddary: yeah, makes sense
[2013-12-17 17:58:07] lukeis: ok :)
[2013-12-17 17:58:17] ddary: the only thing we need to think about are tests
[2013-12-17 17:58:22] lukeis: yes
[2013-12-17 17:58:30] lukeis: well, the tests exist in the selenium project
[2013-12-17 17:58:40] ddary: for the android driver (the original one) some tests exists, right?
[2013-12-17 17:58:44] lukeis: i can add targets there to be able to run them
[2013-12-17 17:58:47] lukeis: yes
[2013-12-17 17:59:10] lukeis: except just today simon removed most of the references to AndroidDriver ;)
[2013-12-17 17:59:15] lukeis: so I may have to put some back
[2013-12-17 17:59:35] ddary: yeah, that is the way how it works
[2013-12-17 17:59:50] ddary: what do you think, how long it will take to add it?
[2013-12-17 18:00:01] lukeis: a week or two
[2013-12-17 18:00:31] ddary: k
[2013-12-17 18:00:33] lukeis: i'm taking time off work over the holidays and staying at home, should be able to work on it then
[2013-12-17 18:00:50] lukeis: i started locally and think i'm 1/4 of the way done ;)
[2013-12-17 18:01:07] ddary: the other thing, do you know when in the client bindings the switch context stuff will be available?
[2013-12-17 18:01:42] lukeis: when someone gets off their butt and does it? :)
[2013-12-17 18:02:02] lukeis: someone needs to put it in a spec or the json wire protocol
[2013-12-17 18:02:21] lukeis: brb
[2013-12-17 18:02:29] ddary: we have this 'mobile' spec
[2013-12-17 18:04:03] ddary: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/spec-draft.md?repo=mobile#135
[2013-12-17 18:09:36] lukeis: why is the GET plural and the POST singular?  (i mean it makes sense linguistically, but not necessarily in an API endpoint)
