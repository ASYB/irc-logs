[2013-12-17 00:00:44] lukeis1: jack090: I'm now seeing an x86 image for API 19
[2013-12-17 00:05:01] jack090: awesome
[2013-12-17 00:05:07] jack090: I'll get myself a copy :-)
[2013-12-17 00:05:14] jack090: thanks for the heads up lukeis1
[2013-12-17 00:05:28] lukeis1, changing nick to lukeis.
[2013-12-17 00:06:19] jack090: so selendroid 2.8 will have the fix to run web?
[2013-12-17 00:06:23] jack090: or chromedriver?
[2013-12-17 00:06:38] lukeis: what's 2.8?
[2013-12-17 00:06:50] jack090: * lukeis has a patch that was sumbittedâ€¦ so 2.8 will have a fix for it
[2013-12-17 00:06:54] lukeis: oh, chromedriver 2.8
[2013-12-17 00:07:00] lukeis: 2.7 is current release
[2013-12-17 00:07:04] jack090: ahhh
[2013-12-17 00:07:08] jack090: gotcha thanks
[2013-12-17 00:07:35] jack090: http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html
[2013-12-17 00:08:00] jack090: it'll be next version or is there a "dev" branch I can compile?
[2013-12-17 00:08:01] lukeis: yep
[2013-12-17 00:08:31] lukeis: you can compile if you checkout *ALL OF CHROME* and then build chromedriverâ€¦. not for the faint of heart
[2013-12-17 00:08:39] jack090: hrm...
[2013-12-17 00:08:43] jack090: I might just wait hehe
[2013-12-17 00:08:43] lukeis: s/chrome/chromium/
[2013-12-17 00:08:57] lukeis: took me 3 days just to figure out how to build it ;)
[2013-12-17 00:09:49] lukeis: of course no one was there to answer my questions and the documentation was hard to followâ€¦. so, I could walk you through it quickly, but the cloning of the source tree will take a while
[2013-12-17 00:10:56] jack090: Yea I'll just wait
[2013-12-17 00:11:05] jack090: so my options to run web on android are:
[2013-12-17 00:11:17] jack090: selendroid Or chromedriver 2.8
[2013-12-17 00:11:33] jack090: but selendroid will require me to create my own webview apk
[2013-12-17 00:11:42] jack090: and "launch" it as an app
[2013-12-17 00:12:58] selendroid-git, joining. (#selendroid)
[2013-12-17 00:12:58] selendroid-git: [selendroid] lukeis pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/BXlp6Q
[2013-12-17 00:12:58] selendroid-git: selendroid/master 85e5655 Luke Inman-Semerau: adding android-driver, simple webview app...
[2013-12-17 00:12:58] selendroid-git, leaving. (#selendroid)
[2013-12-17 00:13:09] lukeis: here ya goâ€¦ there's your "own" webview app ;)
[2013-12-17 00:13:21] lukeis: my work is in progress on making this easier
[2013-12-17 00:14:08] lukeis: if you have the source of selendroid, go into that new folder and run `mvn package`  and in target you'll have a new apk for the webview app to run against
