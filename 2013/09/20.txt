[2013-09-20 07:36:51] ddary: Guten Morgen!
[2013-09-20 07:37:02] ddary: thanks for the gist
[2013-09-20 07:37:08] ddary: looking at it right now
[2013-09-20 07:37:55] ddary: that it waht I looked for!
[2013-09-20 07:38:08] lukeis: good ;)
[2013-09-20 07:38:21] ddary: the other thing i just fogured out
[2013-09-20 07:38:24] lukeis: related: my last commit to selendroid
[2013-09-20 07:38:54] ddary: yeah
[2013-09-20 07:39:32] ddary: i think logcat is better
[2013-09-20 07:39:41] lukeis: yeah, so do i :)
[2013-09-20 07:39:45] ddary: :-)
[2013-09-20 07:40:03] ddary: did you had issues with the webviews?
[2013-09-20 07:40:29] ddary: i updated the atoms from 0.4.2 to 0.5.0
[2013-09-20 07:40:45] lukeis: I currently don't do much with them, so I'm not having 'issues' right nowâ€¦ there are plenty of things wrong though ;)
[2013-09-20 07:40:45] ddary: but it seems like now in the test app everything is fine
[2013-09-20 07:40:57] ddary: but we have issues in the corporate one
[2013-09-20 07:41:47] ddary: you mean in selendroid or in ypur test suite?
[2013-09-20 07:42:13] lukeis: since the only webview I care about in this exact moment is a login screen, I do everything via javascript myself and then I 'click' on one thing :)   (in the near future that is not going to be the case and I'm sure i'll be troubleshooting webview issues very soon)
[2013-09-20 07:42:25] lukeis: in my app / test suite
[2013-09-20 07:43:01] ddary: ok
[2013-09-20 07:43:35] ddary: one issue that I know in selendroid is per se the ChromeClient
[2013-09-20 07:43:57] ddary: I did it half  year ago, because there it was the only stable way of executing javascript
[2013-09-20 07:44:36] ddary: the thing is, if someone has in the app a own ChromeClient ...
[2013-09-20 07:44:49] ddary: it will be replaced by selendroid
[2013-09-20 07:47:38] chhsiung, joining. (#selendroid)
[2013-09-20 08:06:03] ddary: lukeis: how does this work in detail with the atoms
[2013-09-20 08:06:25] ddary: who is developing them? are they still updated?
[2013-09-20 08:07:23] lukeis: the atoms? they are still worked on, minor adjustments all the time (especially with visibility lately) mostly the guys at google
[2013-09-20 08:07:44] lukeis: i don't think too many are testing it out on android ;)
[2013-09-20 08:08:10] lukeis: and if they areâ€¦ it's likely on Chrome (not Android's default browser)
[2013-09-20 08:10:20] ddary: but they are still used in other contexts, right?
[2013-09-20 08:10:28] ddary: so still maintained etc
[2013-09-20 08:10:32] lukeis: yes
[2013-09-20 08:11:06] ddary: the weird thing is, that with the test app everyhting is fine, all the locators are working as expected
[2013-09-20 08:11:28] ddary: but other pages, i get messages like function not there
[2013-09-20 08:11:40] ddary: but it is not something meaningful
[2013-09-20 08:12:29] ddary: but maybe i just try to build a new version of the atoms, the current one we have in the project are from 2.32 (androiddriver)

[2013-09-20 18:05:28] mummana: like u mean filck in a while loop?
[2013-09-20 18:05:43] lukeis: if you need to incrementally, then sure

[2013-09-20 18:07:22] lukeis: you'll need to use UI Automator
[2013-09-20 18:07:53] lukeis: selendroid doesn't support the pre-installed apps (yet? :) )
[2013-09-20 18:08:46] mummana: UI automator for wt?

[2013-09-20 18:09:07] mummana: mine is api15 device
[2013-09-20 18:09:21] lukeis: then you won't be able to do it
[2013-09-20 18:10:00] lukeis: API16 it was introducedâ€¦ API18 is where Instrumentation will have the possibility to call UIAutomator bits
[2013-09-20 18:10:09] mummana: no i mean is there any possiblity to test ppre installed apps
[2013-09-20 18:10:23] lukeis: API16+ using UIAutomator
[2013-09-20 18:10:44] lukeis: http://developer.android.com/tools/help/uiautomator/index.html
[2013-09-20 18:11:04] mummana: then how can i launch the app using selendroid?
[2013-09-20 18:11:12] mummana: in api 16
[2013-09-20 18:11:16] lukeis: you can't
[2013-09-20 18:11:21] lukeis: there is one tool out there that implements the WebDriver API on top of it: appium
[2013-09-20 18:11:53] mummana: yea appium is good but that only works for api17 and api18
[2013-09-20 18:12:10] lukeis: should for 16 too
[2013-09-20 18:12:21] lukeis: unless they have a bug ;)
[2013-09-20 18:12:35] mummana: so you mena using selendroid i cant test pre installed apps right?
[2013-09-20 18:12:45] lukeis: that is correct

[2013-09-20 18:14:09] mummana: hmm thnks for the response man and would be more apprciated if you guys open a group in google groups for selendroid
[2013-09-20 18:14:21] lukeis: there is one
[2013-09-20 18:14:33] lukeis: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/selendroid
[2013-09-20 18:14:34] mummana: but no one posts there
[2013-09-20 18:14:44] lukeis: just cause no one has ;)
[2013-09-20 18:14:48] lukeis: dominik and myself are on it
[2013-09-20 18:15:00] lukeis: we don't really need to email / post though
[2013-09-20 18:15:14] mummana: thtas cool than i ll be posting my queries there
[2013-09-20 18:15:38] mummana: oh well beginners like me need it
[2013-09-20 18:15:46] lukeis: sounds good :)
[2013-09-20 18:15:59] lukeis: we'll try to reply as best we can
[2013-09-20 18:16:07] mummana: well :) last question
[2013-09-20 18:16:22] lukeis: sure (but don't limit yourself :-D )
[2013-09-20 18:16:38] mummana: i tried to test  linked.apk
[2013-09-20 18:16:44] mummana: in my api15
[2013-09-20 18:18:03] mummana: device with selendroid ,but the apk doesnt gets installed in the device it throws error an error occured
[2013-09-20 18:19:19] lukeis: you're using the standalone server right? can you :gist  the output from the standalone? (and maybe try running it with the -verbose flag to get more info)
[2013-09-20 18:19:57] mummana: after trying that  to make sure whether the app is working or not i tried to install the app using adb install .apk command and it throwed an error installl faliure
[2013-09-20 18:20:26] lukeis: is there more to the error?
[2013-09-20 18:21:03] mummana: yea some thing like install_failure _cerficates something like this
[2013-09-20 18:21:17] mummana: i dnt remember much :(
[2013-09-20 18:23:25] mummana: there?
[2013-09-20 18:23:53] mummana: [INSTALL_PARSE_FAILED_NO_CERTIFICATES]
[2013-09-20 18:23:59] mummana: yea this one
[2013-09-20 18:24:29] lukeis: sounds like the apk wasn't signed?
[2013-09-20 18:24:41] lukeis: have you built an android app on your computer before?
[2013-09-20 18:25:09] mummana: nope
[2013-09-20 18:25:16] mummana: m a tester
[2013-09-20 18:25:24] lukeis: you have to build (or at least attempt to build) an app in order to get a debug.cert file generated in your users home directory
[2013-09-20 18:26:01] lukeis: if you clone the selendroid project and try to build it, that should work
[2013-09-20 18:26:31] mummana: ok so in order to test the app i must sign it write?
[2013-09-20 18:26:51] mummana: right?
[2013-09-20 18:27:18] lukeis: yes
[2013-09-20 18:27:54] mummana: how to know wheter the app is signed or not?
[2013-09-20 18:28:18] lukeis: well, you get that error for one ;)
[2013-09-20 18:28:40] mummana: http://file.appsapk.com/wp-content/uploads/downloads/LinkedIn.apk
[2013-09-20 18:28:55] mummana: thats the app which i used to test it
[2013-09-20 18:29:06] mummana: LOL
[2013-09-20 18:29:07] mummana: :D
[2013-09-20 18:30:06] lukeis: ok, the point with selendroid is that the app must be re-signed with the same debug certificate that the selendroid app is signed with (so, the debug certificate of the machine running the selendroid-standalone server)
[2013-09-20 18:33:36] mummana: where i can get the debug certificate of   selendroid and my app
[2013-09-20 18:36:20] lukeis: selendroid does it automaticallyâ€¦ assuming you have a debug certificate (which doesn't get created until you build at least one project). Check if you have this file locally: ~/.android/debug.keystore
[2013-09-20 18:38:41] mummana: yea i have it
[2013-09-20 18:39:25] mummana: u mean my linked app doesnt got resigned with same debug certificate?
[2013-09-20 18:39:41] lukeis: selendroid server does it run-time
[2013-09-20 18:39:43] mummana: with of selendroid
[2013-09-20 18:40:06] lukeis: actually when you start selendroid-standalone it should create a file:  resigned-LinkedIn.apk
[2013-09-20 18:40:35] mummana: yea its there in my folder
[2013-09-20 18:41:25] lukeis: okâ€¦ so, can you :gist the full output of the standalone server when you try to run a test against it?   (when you do so, please run with '-verbose' in the command for selendroid-standalone)

[2013-09-20 21:23:04] subu: whats is xspeed and yspeed
[2013-09-20 21:25:17] lukeis: you really don't want that one, unless you're in a webview
[2013-09-20 21:25:36] lukeis: you want   flick(element, xOffset, yOffset, 0)
[2013-09-20 21:26:11] lukeis: last arg is 'speed'  0 == normal, 1 == fast
[2013-09-20 21:31:52] subu: wt about xoffset and yoffset

[2013-09-20 21:43:11] charbrandeis: @lukeis -- can you look at this,please?
[2013-09-20 21:43:11] charbrandeis: I am facing a problem where i am not able to select date/month/year from native date picker using selendroid
[2013-09-20 21:43:11] charbrandeis: i tried this .  driver.findElement(By.id("month")).sendKeys("Oct");  But it's not working
[2013-09-20 22:01:04] lukeis: charbrandeis: is this in a native component? with a DatePicker object? (not a webview)  if soâ€¦ I don't think we've explicitly handled that code path in selendroid, I don't see any code handling DatePicker objects (nor calling the method needed to be calledâ€¦ updateDate)
[2013-09-20 22:06:26] charbrandeis: yes, it's in a native component with a date picker object..
[2013-09-20 22:06:49] chhsiung, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-09-20 22:07:04] lukeis: ok, then I don't see that being handled in selendroid currently
[2013-09-20 22:07:26] charbrandeis: Thanks .any plans to fix ?
[2013-09-20 22:07:47] lukeis: since I don't have a datepicker in my app that i'm testingâ€¦ nope :)
[2013-09-20 22:08:32] lukeis: dominik may be more inclined to do soâ€¦. i'm a bit slammed with work at the moment
[2013-09-20 22:08:55] charbrandeis: ok .should i file a bug?
[2013-09-20 22:08:56] lukeis: (although 'the moment' has been all year, so i'm not sure when it will clear up)
[2013-09-20 22:08:59] lukeis: sure
