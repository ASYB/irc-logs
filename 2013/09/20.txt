[2013-09-20 07:36:51] ddary: Guten Morgen!
[2013-09-20 07:37:02] ddary: thanks for the gist
[2013-09-20 07:37:08] ddary: looking at it right now
[2013-09-20 07:37:55] ddary: that it waht I looked for!
[2013-09-20 07:38:08] lukeis: good ;)
[2013-09-20 07:38:21] ddary: the other thing i just fogured out
[2013-09-20 07:38:24] lukeis: related: my last commit to selendroid
[2013-09-20 07:38:54] ddary: yeah
[2013-09-20 07:39:32] ddary: i think logcat is better
[2013-09-20 07:39:41] lukeis: yeah, so do i :)
[2013-09-20 07:39:45] ddary: :-)
[2013-09-20 07:40:03] ddary: did you had issues with the webviews?
[2013-09-20 07:40:29] ddary: i updated the atoms from 0.4.2 to 0.5.0
[2013-09-20 07:40:45] lukeis: I currently don't do much with them, so I'm not having 'issues' right nowâ€¦ there are plenty of things wrong though ;)
[2013-09-20 07:40:45] ddary: but it seems like now in the test app everything is fine
[2013-09-20 07:40:57] ddary: but we have issues in the corporate one
[2013-09-20 07:41:47] ddary: you mean in selendroid or in ypur test suite?
[2013-09-20 07:42:13] lukeis: since the only webview I care about in this exact moment is a login screen, I do everything via javascript myself and then I 'click' on one thing :)   (in the near future that is not going to be the case and I'm sure i'll be troubleshooting webview issues very soon)
[2013-09-20 07:42:25] lukeis: in my app / test suite
[2013-09-20 07:43:01] ddary: ok
[2013-09-20 07:43:35] ddary: one issue that I know in selendroid is per se the ChromeClient
[2013-09-20 07:43:57] ddary: I did it half  year ago, because there it was the only stable way of executing javascript
[2013-09-20 07:44:36] ddary: the thing is, if someone has in the app a own ChromeClient ...
[2013-09-20 07:44:49] ddary: it will be replaced by selendroid
[2013-09-20 07:47:38] chhsiung, joining. (#selendroid)
[2013-09-20 08:06:03] ddary: lukeis: how does this work in detail with the atoms
[2013-09-20 08:06:25] ddary: who is developing them? are they still updated?
[2013-09-20 08:07:23] lukeis: the atoms? they are still worked on, minor adjustments all the time (especially with visibility lately) mostly the guys at google
[2013-09-20 08:07:44] lukeis: i don't think too many are testing it out on android ;)
[2013-09-20 08:08:10] lukeis: and if they areâ€¦ it's likely on Chrome (not Android's default browser)
[2013-09-20 08:10:20] ddary: but they are still used in other contexts, right?
[2013-09-20 08:10:28] ddary: so still maintained etc
[2013-09-20 08:10:32] lukeis: yes
[2013-09-20 08:11:06] ddary: the weird thing is, that with the test app everyhting is fine, all the locators are working as expected
[2013-09-20 08:11:28] ddary: but other pages, i get messages like function not there
[2013-09-20 08:11:40] ddary: but it is not something meaningful
[2013-09-20 08:12:29] ddary: but maybe i just try to build a new version of the atoms, the current one we have in the project are from 2.32 (androiddriver)
