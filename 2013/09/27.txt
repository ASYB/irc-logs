[2013-09-27 14:19:54] mummana:  in the same app at some elements tap getsure is working fine
[2013-09-27 14:20:14] mummana: y this is happenng?
[2013-09-27 14:20:43] ddary: i have this seen sometimes but have no explanation for that
[2013-09-27 14:20:54] mummana: :(
[2013-09-27 14:21:04] ddary: click and tap are in the end the same, but still behave the differently
[2013-09-27 14:21:45] ddary: So, if you know someone with deep knowledge about motion events, please let me know ;-)
[2013-09-27 14:21:55] mummana: well will this  issue be solved?? in later editions?
[2013-09-27 14:21:57] mummana: LOL
[2013-09-27 14:22:04] mummana: hmmm well surely
[2013-09-27 14:22:32] ddary: if I know how to fix it, there is no reason not to fix it, right?
[2013-09-27 14:23:12] mummana: well i ave another question
[2013-09-27 14:23:17] mummana: *have
[2013-09-27 14:24:14] mummana: i have a list with many fruit items
[2013-09-27 14:24:48] mummana: i want to scroll ,find the required fruit and has to click on it , is there any function ?
[2013-09-27 14:25:11] ddary: what android element do you talk about?
[2013-09-27 14:25:14] ddary: ListView?
[2013-09-27 14:25:24] mummana: yup listview
[2013-09-27 14:26:06] ddary: you have to write it on your own: find element, if nothing is there, scroll down, find element, scroll down
[2013-09-27 14:26:23] ddary: sounds weird, but currently there is no other way to do it
[2013-09-27 14:26:36] mummana: i have seen scroll in touch actions will it work ? i mean u havent mention scroll gesture in ur website rite?
[2013-09-27 14:26:51] ddary: would recommend to use flick
[2013-09-27 14:27:00] ddary: that was working fine in my context
[2013-09-27 14:27:06] mummana: u mean while loop with flick?
[2013-09-27 14:27:35] ddary: something like that
[2013-09-27 14:27:57] mummana: well in  flick(WebElement onElement, int xOffset, int yOffset, int speed)
[2013-09-27 14:27:58] ddary: I had done it for my company, but not able to share the code
[2013-09-27 14:28:19] mummana: yea sure its oki e
[2013-09-27 14:28:30] mummana: wt is xoffset and yoffset?
[2013-09-27 14:28:50] ddary: http://selendroid.io/gestures.html
[2013-09-27 14:28:54] ddary: there is an example
[2013-09-27 14:28:54] mummana: i mean from where i can get those values?
[2013-09-27 14:29:56] ddary: the sample is about to flick to the left by 100 px
