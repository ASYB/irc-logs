[2013-09-12 00:11:32] chhsiung: i guess i see value in knowing that the app is a clean install
[2013-09-12 00:11:36] chhsiung: but it seems really slow
[2013-09-12 00:11:43] chhsiung: to uninstall/reinstall each time :(
[2013-09-12 00:12:03] lukeis: yeah, i re-use the session when a test is successful

[2013-09-12 14:33:49] ddary: hi Ahmed_
[2013-09-12 14:33:55] ddary: I looked into the code
[2013-09-12 14:34:06] ddary: that is conrolled by implicit wait
[2013-09-12 14:34:21] ddary: so, whatever the tester is using is used
[2013-09-12 14:34:46] ddary: driver.manage().timeouts().implicitWait()
[2013-09-12 14:35:45] Ahmed_: first time to know about that
[2013-09-12 14:35:59] Ahmed_: pardon me I'm still learning :)
[2013-09-12 14:36:47] Ahmed_: but what will happen after that?
[2013-09-12 14:36:56] ddary: nothing:)
[2013-09-12 14:37:15] Ahmed_: but this will not solve the problem :/
[2013-09-12 14:37:24] ddary: the thing is, there is a server site wait that is used when you search for elements
[2013-09-12 14:37:59] ddary: if this timeout is 15sec, the server on the device will try to find the element for 15sec (looping)
[2013-09-12 14:38:10] ddary: this is a global wait
[2013-09-12 14:38:22] Ahmed_: and if not found
[2013-09-12 14:38:28] Ahmed_: the request will not be executed
[2013-09-12 14:38:29] ddary: the other option a tester has is to say: use the client site wait
[2013-09-12 14:38:59] ddary: if not found, there will be the error thrown NoSuchElement
[2013-09-12 14:39:10] Ahmed_: the problem is the element is viewed and focused, but the methods are returning false
[2013-09-12 14:39:47] ddary: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol#/session/:sessionId/element
[2013-09-12 14:40:11] ddary: you can try to set the implicit wait to 5 seconds and see if it helps
[2013-09-12 14:42:13] Ahmed_: ok here's a question
[2013-09-12 14:42:20] Ahmed_: that you'll not like
[2013-09-12 14:42:22] Ahmed_: :D
[2013-09-12 14:42:22] Ahmed_: https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/blob/master/selendroid-server/src/main/java/io/selendroid/server/model/AndroidNativeElement.java#L100
[2013-09-12 14:42:31] Ahmed_: can I remove the throwing exception part?
[2013-09-12 14:43:56] Ahmed_: because for some apps (like my app) there's some views that are focused and showed
[2013-09-12 14:44:09] Ahmed_: but Android *thinks* they're not
[2013-09-12 14:44:25] Ahmed_: not sure if the problem with Android or selendroid
[2013-09-12 14:45:27] Ahmed_: and I don't think this limitation is important
[2013-09-12 14:45:44] Ahmed_: why sendKeys or Clicks to only showed eleements?
[2013-09-12 14:47:11] ddary: it is kind of important, because the user should see what happens and befor that is done there is the autoscroll
[2013-09-12 14:47:47] ddary: first i would like to understand, what this method returns:
[2013-09-12 14:48:01] ddary: isDisplayed()
[2013-09-12 14:48:03] ddary: return view.hasWindowFocus() && view.isEnabled() && view.isShown() && (view.getWidth() > 0)
[2013-09-12 14:48:03] ddary:         && (view.getHeight() > 0);
[2013-09-12 14:48:33] Ahmed_: for me , view.isShown() and view.hasWindowFocus() are returning false
[2013-09-12 14:48:35] ddary: do you know how to debug the selndroid code?
[2013-09-12 14:48:49] Ahmed_: yes they're returning false
[2013-09-12 14:48:58] Ahmed_: but the view is infront of me :)
[2013-09-12 14:49:05] Ahmed_: I removed them
[2013-09-12 14:49:08] Ahmed_: and the keys were sent
[2013-09-12 14:49:12] Ahmed_: and everything worked
[2013-09-12 14:49:40] ddary: they are rendered in the viewport, that is what you mean, right?
[2013-09-12 14:49:55] ddary: so, you don't have to scroll to see the element
[2013-09-12 14:49:58] Ahmed_: no
[2013-09-12 14:49:59] ddary: right?
[2013-09-12 14:50:01] Ahmed_: no scrolling here
[2013-09-12 14:50:07] ddary: ok
[2013-09-12 14:50:44] Ahmed_: fyi:
[2013-09-12 14:50:48] Ahmed_: the case was exactly like that
[2013-09-12 14:50:54] Ahmed_: I start facebook app
[2013-09-12 14:50:57] Ahmed_: click on status
[2013-09-12 14:51:05] Ahmed_: choose the text area
[2013-09-12 14:51:19] ddary: it would be very important for me to understand first, why the elment is returning is shown and has focus == false
[2013-09-12 14:52:14] Ahmed_: after choosing the text area I couldn't send keys because of that
[2013-09-12 14:52:37] Ahmed_: I think the problem is not with selendroid
[2013-09-12 14:53:01] ddary: are you sending the keys via: element.sendKeys("blabla")
[2013-09-12 14:53:05] ddary: or:
[2013-09-12 14:53:33] ddary: ((HasInputDevices)driver).getKeyboard().sendKeys(searchTerm);
[2013-09-12 14:54:48] Ahmed_: element.sendKeys
[2013-09-12 14:56:50] ddary: the other approach could be
[2013-09-12 14:57:19] ddary: click the element and then sent the text via keyboard
[2013-09-12 14:57:30] Ahmed_: clicking the element doesn't work
[2013-09-12 14:57:31] ddary: (maybe that is working)
[2013-09-12 14:57:38] ddary: same issue, right
[2013-09-12 14:57:39] Ahmed_: it fails for the same reasone
[2013-09-12 14:57:43] ddary: :-)
[2013-09-12 14:57:45] Ahmed_: reason*
[2013-09-12 14:59:06] Ahmed_: my suggestion is just to add like a 5 sec wait and then execute anyway
[2013-09-12 14:59:10] Ahmed_: I know this is not perfect
[2013-09-12 14:59:37] Ahmed_: but the case is very rare and hard to reproduce
[2013-09-12 15:05:03] ddary: i still think the current implementation is in general the right one: if there is an bug or we there is a better way to identify that the element is on the viewport, we should fix that
[2013-09-12 15:06:03] ddary: for me isDisplayed() is the key method
[2013-09-12 15:06:28] ddary: can you try to find a better way of identifying if the element is dispalyed?
[2013-09-12 15:06:49] Ahmed_: will try
[2013-09-12 15:10:07] ddary: thanks, that sounds great

[2013-09-12 15:50:12] Ahmed_: ddary I don't know if this might help
[2013-09-12 15:50:34] Ahmed_: but the element that I was trying to type inside
[2013-09-12 15:50:39] Ahmed_: has some text
[2013-09-12 15:50:47] Ahmed_: when I try to find by this text
[2013-09-12 15:51:01] Ahmed_: like By.linkText("bala")
[2013-09-12 15:51:11] Ahmed_: selendroid can't get the element
[2013-09-12 15:51:49] Ahmed_: I was using By.className
[2013-09-12 15:51:53] Ahmed_: and it was working
[2013-09-12 15:54:38] Ahmed_: I really believe that the problem is not with selendroid
[2013-09-12 15:55:43] Ahmed_: but if some people are able to do strange things with their app, they still must be able to test it anyway :D

[2013-09-12 17:32:07] Ahmed_: https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/issues/121
[2013-09-12 17:32:17] Ahmed_: since you're the one implemented -InstalledApp
[2013-09-12 17:49:53] Ahmed_: can we somehow find the port of the chosen emulator?
[2013-09-12 17:50:54] lukeis: you can parse the emulator name?
[2013-09-12 17:51:12] Ahmed_: if I do adb devices
[2013-09-12 17:51:15] Ahmed_: I will get the names
[2013-09-12 17:51:17] lukeis: yeah
[2013-09-12 17:51:17] Ahmed_: but the problem is
[2013-09-12 17:51:25] Ahmed_: I don't know which one selendroid has chosen
[2013-09-12 17:52:17] lukeis: doesn't the 'androiddevice' have that info?
[2013-09-12 17:52:19] Ahmed_: how to compare the output of "adb devices" against the list of running emulators that selendroid has
[2013-09-12 17:52:36] lukeis: not sure why you need to do that
[2013-09-12 17:52:46] Ahmed_: adb install app
[2013-09-12 17:52:48] Ahmed_: will not work
[2013-09-12 17:52:56] Ahmed_: if you have 2 emulators working in the same time
[2013-09-12 17:53:01] lukeis: it just needs to pass the serial
[2013-09-12 17:53:07] Ahmed_: exactly
[2013-09-12 17:53:13] Ahmed_: and the serial is not configured
[2013-09-12 17:53:22] Ahmed_: if you choose -InstalledApp
[2013-09-12 17:53:27] Ahmed_: the serial is not configured
[2013-09-12 17:53:51] lukeis: then it should be :)
