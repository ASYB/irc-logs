[2013-09-12 00:00:27] lukeis: i typically only use that locally
[2013-09-12 00:11:24] chhsiung: why only locally?
[2013-09-12 00:11:32] chhsiung: i guess i see value in knowing that the app is a clean install
[2013-09-12 00:11:36] chhsiung: but it seems really slow
[2013-09-12 00:11:43] chhsiung: to uninstall/reinstall each time :(
[2013-09-12 00:12:03] lukeis: yeah, i re-use the session when a test is successful

[2013-09-12 14:31:18] Ahmed_: and after the timeout the we execute the requrest anyway
[2013-09-12 14:31:51] Ahmed_: or maybe we check the width, height and Enabled only
[2013-09-12 14:31:55] Ahmed_: after the timeout

[2013-09-12 14:33:49] ddary: hi Ahmed_
[2013-09-12 14:33:55] ddary: I looked into the code
[2013-09-12 14:34:06] ddary: that is conrolled by implicit wait
[2013-09-12 14:34:21] ddary: so, whatever the tester is using is used
[2013-09-12 14:34:46] ddary: driver.manage().timeouts().implicitWait()
[2013-09-12 14:35:45] Ahmed_: first time to know about that
[2013-09-12 14:35:59] Ahmed_: pardon me I'm still learning :)
[2013-09-12 14:36:47] Ahmed_: but what will happen after that?
[2013-09-12 14:36:56] ddary: nothing:)
[2013-09-12 14:37:15] Ahmed_: but this will not solve the problem :/
[2013-09-12 14:37:24] ddary: the thing is, there is a server site wait that is used when you search for elements
[2013-09-12 14:37:59] ddary: if this timeout is 15sec, the server on the device will try to find the element for 15sec (looping)
[2013-09-12 14:38:10] ddary: this is a global wait
[2013-09-12 14:38:22] Ahmed_: and if not found
[2013-09-12 14:38:28] Ahmed_: the request will not be executed
[2013-09-12 14:38:29] ddary: the other option a tester has is to say: use the client site wait
[2013-09-12 14:38:59] ddary: if not found, there will be the error thrown NoSuchElement
[2013-09-12 14:39:10] Ahmed_: the problem is the element is viewed and focused, but the methods are returning false
[2013-09-12 14:39:47] ddary: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol#/session/:sessionId/element
[2013-09-12 14:40:11] ddary: you can try to set the implicit wait to 5 seconds and see if it helps
[2013-09-12 14:42:13] Ahmed_: ok here's a question
[2013-09-12 14:42:20] Ahmed_: that you'll not like
[2013-09-12 14:42:22] Ahmed_: :D
[2013-09-12 14:42:22] Ahmed_: https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/blob/master/selendroid-server/src/main/java/io/selendroid/server/model/AndroidNativeElement.java#L100
[2013-09-12 14:42:31] Ahmed_: can I remove the throwing exception part?
[2013-09-12 14:43:56] Ahmed_: because for some apps (like my app) there's some views that are focused and showed
[2013-09-12 14:44:09] Ahmed_: but Android *thinks* they're not
[2013-09-12 14:44:25] Ahmed_: not sure if the problem with Android or selendroid
