[2013-09-09 10:26:23] Ahmed_: hi @ddary
[2013-09-09 10:26:30] ddary: hi
[2013-09-09 10:27:06] Ahmed_: this is my first time to make a pull request, so how do changes work?
[2013-09-09 10:27:19] Ahmed_: can I make the changes and amend the original commit?
[2013-09-09 10:27:22] Ahmed_: will that work?
[2013-09-09 10:27:44] Ahmed_: or make new pull request?
[2013-09-09 10:27:44] ddary: i would just change the stuff in your repo and then we figure out
[2013-09-09 10:31:39] ddary: we will see
[2013-09-09 10:32:25] ddary: there should be a way to select in the existing PR the latest commits
[2013-09-09 10:46:03] Ahmed_: I added commits
[2013-09-09 11:15:12] ddary: ok
[2013-09-09 11:15:26] ddary: will have a look after noon
[2013-09-09 11:20:04] Ahmed_: also note that these changes are not significant, they're just options to make selendroid more felixable, and I think they're important for any attempt to support multiple apps testing formally
[2013-09-09 11:21:24] ddary: sure, i have that in mind, but also please understand that we meed to guarantee that it is consistent @see comment about next port number
[2013-09-09 11:25:47] Ahmed_: yes this one was my fault, I corrected it.
[2013-09-09 11:29:24] ddary: no worries

[2013-09-09 16:12:54] Ahmed_: @ddary: I'm waiting for the legal department to reply
[2013-09-09 16:13:06] Ahmed_: they're in Menlo Park
[2013-09-09 16:13:34] ddary: yeah, i thought already that would be the case ...
[2013-09-09 16:26:32] Ahmed_: @ddary: can I add in the capabilities an option to whether start the main activity or not?
[2013-09-09 16:26:41] Ahmed_: do you think this is the right place to add this option?
[2013-09-09 16:27:24] ddary: i guess we don't need it because of i have overwritten the get method.
[2013-09-09 16:28:15] ddary: e.g.: https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/blob/master/selendroid-test-app/src/test/java/io/selendroid/support/BaseAndroidTest.java?source=cc#L65
[2013-09-09 16:28:22] ddary: here you see an example
[2013-09-09 16:29:39] Ahmed_: I mean what should I do if I want to create a driver but without starting the main Activity ?
[2013-09-09 16:30:20] Ahmed_: I think you misunderstood me
[2013-09-09 16:30:45] ddary: yeah
[2013-09-09 16:31:22] ddary: the thing is, the reason why always the main activity is started, is that this tells the user, the server is there. and it is a nice visual way
[2013-09-09 16:31:57] ddary: removing that, would trigger definitely a lot of questions that we can avoid
[2013-09-09 16:31:59] Ahmed_: I know
[2013-09-09 16:32:03] Ahmed_: it is
[2013-09-09 16:32:18] Ahmed_: but adding the option will just make it more felixable
[2013-09-09 16:33:09] ddary: right, the thing is, I prefer to keep it as simple as possible and as flexible as needed
[2013-09-09 16:33:32] ddary: what i mean with that is, that by adding for everything an option confuses people
[2013-09-09 16:33:46] ddary: so, what I suggest is,that we keep it as it is
[2013-09-09 16:33:56] ddary: we do not add that option now
[2013-09-09 16:34:16] ddary: and if we see, that it makes sense to add it, we still can add it
[2013-09-09 16:34:22] ddary: does this makes sense?
[2013-09-09 16:34:27] Ahmed_: yes
[2013-09-09 16:34:47] ddary: great :-)
[2013-09-09 16:35:48] ddary: my suggestion would be as well, that maybe you continue working on that feature and if everything is ready, i mean completely with a full integration test, so that everyone can use it as well, we merge it in
[2013-09-09 16:35:54] ddary: is that ok for you?
[2013-09-09 16:36:22] ddary: i think the pull request it a good point to discuss the changes
[2013-09-09 16:36:42] Ahmed_: which feature ?
[2013-09-09 16:36:59] Ahmed_: the option to start mainActicity or not?
[2013-09-09 16:37:02] Ahmed_: or the whole thing?
[2013-09-09 16:37:04] ddary: if everything is fine and is working in your company fine, then merging it in and also releasing it is not a big thing
[2013-09-09 16:37:07] ddary: the whole thing
[2013-09-09 16:37:21] ddary: support for multiple instrumentation servers
[2013-09-09 16:37:29] ddary: is that ok for you?
[2013-09-09 16:37:44] Ahmed_: yes it is.
[2013-09-09 16:42:17] ddary: ok
[2013-09-09 16:45:49] Ahmed_: but I think this one is not going to confuse the users :D
[2013-09-09 16:45:55] Ahmed_: because users will still be able to do the following without any changes
[2013-09-09 16:46:02] Ahmed_: SelendroidCapabilities cap = SelendroidCapabilities.emulator(DeviceTargetPlatform.ANDROID17, "io.selendroid.testapp:1.0");
[2013-09-09 16:46:11] Ahmed_: what I'm asking is being able to add the following (Only if you want to) : cap.setStartMainActivity(false);
[2013-09-09 16:46:23] Ahmed_: I don't think this is confusing to anyone :D
[2013-09-09 16:47:25] ddary: mho, I'm not sure, I see your point
[2013-09-09 16:47:43] ddary: I suggest we ask lukeis what he thinks
[2013-09-09 16:48:23] Ahmed_: ok
[2013-09-09 16:48:33] ddary: :note lukeis what do you think about adding SelendroidCapabilities.setStartMainActivity(false)

[2013-09-09 18:43:37] lukeis: i don't have a need for it

[2013-09-09 18:43:48] lukeis: nope

[2013-09-09 19:00:19] Ahmed_: lukeis: -InstalledApp forces the app to be installed before starting the session
[2013-09-09 19:00:31] Ahmed_: i.e if I have a new emulator
[2013-09-09 19:00:35] Ahmed_: and I opened it
[2013-09-09 19:00:47] Ahmed_: and I want to run install the app and use it

[2013-09-09 19:04:45] lukeis: what endpoint?
[2013-09-09 19:06:06] Ahmed_: to be able to find elements any text contained in the description

[2013-09-09 20:23:59] lukeis: hiya ddary
[2013-09-09 20:24:02] ddary: was a mistake
[2013-09-09 20:24:06] ddary: sorry for that
[2013-09-09 20:24:08] lukeis: no worries ;)
[2013-09-09 20:24:10] ddary: should work now
[2013-09-09 20:25:24] lukeis: cool, thx :)
[2013-09-09 20:30:31] lukeis: so, I still intermittently get some hung requests in my CI… trying to run down root cause still (what I was doing in that last commit).  But for the past couple weeks I've lost all support of the dev team on the UI tests as they are 'focus on delivery' until dreamforce… it's a pain to maintain their tests when they change the UI every other day and not the tests and they still don't have much faith in it since I haven't gott
[2013-09-09 20:31:46] ddary: oh my good
[2013-09-09 20:32:14] ddary: in my case the emulators are working ok, relatively stable
[2013-09-09 20:32:24] lukeis: yeah, the emulators are stable
[2013-09-09 20:32:29] ddary: the only thing that is hard, is that the starting time is long
[2013-09-09 20:32:34] lukeis: communicating with the selendroid server sometimes isn't
[2013-09-09 20:32:38] ddary: in average around 45 seconds
[2013-09-09 20:33:01] lukeis: yeah, i'm around 1 min with snapshots
[2013-09-09 20:33:25] ddary: how stable is it with snapshots?
[2013-09-09 20:33:35] lukeis: oh, my 1 min includes installing / uninstalling the app and starting instrumentation ;)
[2013-09-09 20:33:48] lukeis: pretty stable
[2013-09-09 20:34:03] lukeis: snapshots can get corrupt (has happened to me locally, but not on my CI)
[2013-09-09 20:34:08] ddary: but you need to have it enabled in the emulator, right?
[2013-09-09 20:34:30] lukeis: yeah, in the emulator config it needs to be enabled and you need to set it up once
[2013-09-09 20:34:44] lukeis: (aka start the emulator and 'save' the snapshot)
[2013-09-09 20:34:54] ddary: what we can try to do, is to find out if the emulator supports snapshots and then start it in the right way
[2013-09-09 20:34:57] lukeis: i told selendroid to not save the snapshot
[2013-09-09 20:35:03] ddary: i know
[2013-09-09 20:35:22] lukeis: currently that's what it does
[2013-09-09 20:35:32] lukeis: if there's a snapshot it'll start it that way
[2013-09-09 20:35:42] Ahmed_: I managed to run the emulator once and install the app and start it while it's working
[2013-09-09 20:35:59] ddary: I'm in the good position to use all the time the x86 emulator, but if we can speed up the starting time for the arm friends, it would be a good thing
[2013-09-09 20:36:04] Ahmed_: I mean start the emulator once and then run all the tests without restarting it.
[2013-09-09 20:36:35] lukeis: yeah, locally I can do that… I didn't want that in CI
[2013-09-09 20:37:04] Ahmed_: sorry but what does CI stand for? :D
[2013-09-09 20:37:13] lukeis: Continuous Integration
[2013-09-09 20:37:17] lukeis: build server ;)
[2013-09-09 20:37:36] lukeis: (you know, like Jenkins) :)
[2013-09-09 20:37:58] Ahmed_: do you install the app in each test?

[2013-09-09 20:38:55] lukeis: ddary: i'm also running in saucelabs too… from request to app up and running is ~4 min… but I'm able to run 35 threads at once there ;)
[2013-09-09 20:39:26] ddary: that is not bad
[2013-09-09 20:39:55] lukeis: right now my entire suite takes ~9 hours… but run in parallel it takes ~40min :-D

[2013-09-09 23:30:21] lukeis: i tried the code change and it didn't work
[2013-09-09 23:30:36] Ahmed_: just add the package name to the mainActivity class name
[2013-09-09 23:30:38] Ahmed_: and it's done.
[2013-09-09 23:31:00] lukeis: in my actual app?
[2013-09-09 23:31:10] Ahmed_: no
[2013-09-09 23:31:13] Ahmed_: the option
[2013-09-09 23:31:23] Ahmed_: -InstalledApp com.selendroid.testapp/com.selendroid.testapp.mainActivity:version
[2013-09-09 23:31:40] lukeis: that seems silly to me ;)
[2013-09-09 23:31:52] Ahmed_: but for me it's like this
[2013-09-09 23:32:03] Ahmed_: com.selendroid.XYZ/com.selendroid.testapp.mainActivity:version
[2013-09-09 23:32:19] Ahmed_: the package name is different
[2013-09-09 23:32:23] lukeis: there has to be a better way :-/
[2013-09-09 23:32:40] Ahmed_: I don't think there's
[2013-09-09 23:32:51] Ahmed_: because the package name of the app is independent
[2013-09-09 23:33:25] Ahmed_: that's why we have to split them
[2013-09-09 23:34:02] lukeis: ok… then I expect a PR to update the docs too :-D
[2013-09-09 23:35:04] lukeis: also i refactored AbstractDevice a bit… you'll need to merge / rebase your change
[2013-09-09 23:36:49] Ahmed_: ok
[2013-09-09 23:36:58] lukeis: actually, i know a solution that will work for me and you… you can check if there are any "." in ActivityName, if not, pre-pend the PackageName
[2013-09-09 23:37:41] lukeis: (when it's parsing the installedApp parameter)
[2013-09-09 23:37:42] Ahmed_: nice
[2013-09-09 23:37:51] Ahmed_: will do it.
[2013-09-09 23:53:52] chhsiung, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
