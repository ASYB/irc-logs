[2013-09-09 10:26:23] Ahmed_: hi @ddary
[2013-09-09 10:26:30] ddary: hi
[2013-09-09 10:27:06] Ahmed_: this is my first time to make a pull request, so how do changes work?
[2013-09-09 10:27:19] Ahmed_: can I make the changes and amend the original commit?
[2013-09-09 10:27:22] Ahmed_: will that work?
[2013-09-09 10:27:44] Ahmed_: or make new pull request?
[2013-09-09 10:27:44] ddary: i would just change the stuff in your repo and then we figure out
[2013-09-09 10:31:39] ddary: we will see
[2013-09-09 10:32:25] ddary: there should be a way to select in the existing PR the latest commits
[2013-09-09 10:46:03] Ahmed_: I added commits
[2013-09-09 11:15:12] ddary: ok
[2013-09-09 11:15:26] ddary: will have a look after noon
[2013-09-09 11:20:04] Ahmed_: also note that these changes are not significant, they're just options to make selendroid more felixable, and I think they're important for any attempt to support multiple apps testing formally
[2013-09-09 11:21:24] ddary: sure, i have that in mind, but also please understand that we meed to guarantee that it is consistent @see comment about next port number
[2013-09-09 11:25:47] Ahmed_: yes this one was my fault, I corrected it.
[2013-09-09 11:29:24] ddary: no worries
[2013-09-09 14:01:22] ddary: @Ahmed_: can you please sign the CLA...

[2013-09-09 16:12:54] Ahmed_: @ddary: I'm waiting for the legal department to reply
[2013-09-09 16:13:06] Ahmed_: they're in Menlo Park
[2013-09-09 16:13:34] ddary: yeah, i thought already that would be the case ...
[2013-09-09 16:26:32] Ahmed_: @ddary: can I add in the capabilities an option to whether start the main activity or not?
[2013-09-09 16:26:41] Ahmed_: do you think this is the right place to add this option?
[2013-09-09 16:27:24] ddary: i guess we don't need it because of i have overwritten the get method.
[2013-09-09 16:28:15] ddary: e.g.: https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/blob/master/selendroid-test-app/src/test/java/io/selendroid/support/BaseAndroidTest.java?source=cc#L65
[2013-09-09 16:28:22] ddary: here you see an example
[2013-09-09 16:29:39] Ahmed_: I mean what should I do if I want to create a driver but without starting the main Activity ?
[2013-09-09 16:30:20] Ahmed_: I think you misunderstood me
[2013-09-09 16:30:45] ddary: yeah
[2013-09-09 16:31:22] ddary: the thing is, the reason why always the main activity is started, is that this tells the user, the server is there. and it is a nice visual way
[2013-09-09 16:31:57] ddary: removing that, would trigger definitely a lot of questions that we can avoid
[2013-09-09 16:31:59] Ahmed_: I know
[2013-09-09 16:32:03] Ahmed_: it is
[2013-09-09 16:32:18] Ahmed_: but adding the option will just make it more felixable
[2013-09-09 16:33:09] ddary: right, the thing is, I prefer to keep it as simple as possible and as flexible as needed
[2013-09-09 16:33:32] ddary: what i mean with that is, that by adding for everything an option confuses people
[2013-09-09 16:33:46] ddary: so, what I suggest is,that we keep it as it is
[2013-09-09 16:33:56] ddary: we do not add that option now
[2013-09-09 16:34:16] ddary: and if we see, that it makes sense to add it, we still can add it
[2013-09-09 16:34:22] ddary: does this makes sense?
[2013-09-09 16:34:27] Ahmed_: yes
[2013-09-09 16:34:47] ddary: great :-)
[2013-09-09 16:35:48] ddary: my suggestion would be as well, that maybe you continue working on that feature and if everything is ready, i mean completely with a full integration test, so that everyone can use it as well, we merge it in
[2013-09-09 16:35:54] ddary: is that ok for you?
[2013-09-09 16:36:22] ddary: i think the pull request it a good point to discuss the changes
[2013-09-09 16:36:42] Ahmed_: which feature ?
[2013-09-09 16:36:59] Ahmed_: the option to start mainActicity or not?
[2013-09-09 16:37:02] Ahmed_: or the whole thing?
[2013-09-09 16:37:04] ddary: if everything is fine and is working in your company fine, then merging it in and also releasing it is not a big thing
[2013-09-09 16:37:07] ddary: the whole thing
[2013-09-09 16:37:21] ddary: support for multiple instrumentation servers
[2013-09-09 16:37:29] ddary: is that ok for you?
[2013-09-09 16:37:44] Ahmed_: yes it is.
[2013-09-09 16:42:17] ddary: ok
[2013-09-09 16:45:49] Ahmed_: but I think this one is not going to confuse the users :D
[2013-09-09 16:45:55] Ahmed_: because users will still be able to do the following without any changes
[2013-09-09 16:46:02] Ahmed_: SelendroidCapabilities cap = SelendroidCapabilities.emulator(DeviceTargetPlatform.ANDROID17, "io.selendroid.testapp:1.0");
[2013-09-09 16:46:11] Ahmed_: what I'm asking is being able to add the following (Only if you want to) : cap.setStartMainActivity(false);
[2013-09-09 16:46:23] Ahmed_: I don't think this is confusing to anyone :D
[2013-09-09 16:47:25] ddary: mho, I'm not sure, I see your point
[2013-09-09 16:47:43] ddary: I suggest we ask lukeis what he thinks
[2013-09-09 16:48:23] Ahmed_: ok
[2013-09-09 16:48:33] ddary: :note lukeis what do you think about adding SelendroidCapabilities.setStartMainActivity(false)
