[2013-09-25 11:53:42] ddary: hi Ahmed__
[2013-09-25 11:54:00] ddary: do you have experience with buck?
[2013-09-25 11:54:11] Ahmed__: no
[2013-09-25 11:54:29] Ahmed__: sorry
[2013-09-25 11:56:03] Ahmed__: @ddary can one standalone server respond to multiple drivers in the same time?
[2013-09-25 11:56:17] Ahmed__: parallel
[2013-09-25 11:56:38] ddary: you mean interact with multiple android devices?
[2013-09-25 11:56:44] ddary: in parallel?
[2013-09-25 11:56:54] Ahmed__: yes
[2013-09-25 11:57:44] ddary: that works fine
[2013-09-25 11:58:10] ddary: I run e.g. in max 5 emulators in parallel
[2013-09-25 11:58:32] Ahmed__: with one selendroid standalone
[2013-09-25 11:58:38] ddary: yes
[2013-09-25 11:58:41] Ahmed__: is there any limitation?
[2013-09-25 11:59:07] ddary: multiple selendroid standalone on the same machine are not supported because the use of ddmlib
[2013-09-25 11:59:18] ddary: not that I'm aware of
[2013-09-25 11:59:26] Ahmed__: if I used 10 in parallel will this affect the performance ?
[2013-09-25 11:59:43] Ahmed__: 10 emulators
[2013-09-25 11:59:56] ddary: in the end, it depends on android (how many ports you can use for emulators) and of course, how powerful yoiur machine is
[2013-09-25 12:00:00] ddary: yes
[2013-09-25 12:00:14] ddary: so, i use 1gb ram per emulator
[2013-09-25 12:00:23] Ahmed__: I understand

[2013-09-25 20:12:10] Ahmed__: @ddary: -Installed app only works if there's exactly one device running
[2013-09-25 20:12:37] ddary: hi ahmed
[2013-09-25 20:12:41] Ahmed__: hi
[2013-09-25 20:13:04] ddary: all the changes with the serial etc you did to work fix that
[2013-09-25 20:13:08] ddary: ?
[2013-09-25 20:13:23] Ahmed__: I don't understand the question sorry
[2013-09-25 20:13:58] ddary: I still don't get the full picture of adding the serial to the capabilities
[2013-09-25 20:14:15] Ahmed__: if you have 2 running devices
[2013-09-25 20:14:21] Ahmed__: both have the AUT installed
[2013-09-25 20:14:29] Ahmed__: how to use -InstalledApp ?
[2013-09-25 20:14:40] Ahmed__: it will not work
[2013-09-25 20:15:37] Ahmed__: that's why I added the serial
[2013-09-25 20:16:16] *lukeis only runs with one at a time ;)'
[2013-09-25 20:16:37] ddary: so, the feature you want is, that if everything is installed, it works very fast and in the case it is not, selendroid-standalone should know what to do, right?
[2013-09-25 20:17:22] Ahmed__: yes
[2013-09-25 20:17:39] ddary: ok
[2013-09-25 20:17:43] Ahmed__: actually I solved this problem with lukeis
[2013-09-25 20:17:52] Ahmed__: and he's one who proposed this solution
[2013-09-25 20:17:59] Ahmed__: he is the one*
[2013-09-25 20:18:49] ddary: ;)
[2013-09-25 20:18:58] lukeis: I was waiting for the update to that PR before merging Ahmed__ ;)
[2013-09-25 20:19:14] lukeis: (and i think you needed to resolve the cla too...)
[2013-09-25 20:19:21] Ahmed__: signed already
[2013-09-25 20:19:24] lukeis: cool
[2013-09-25 20:19:31] Ahmed__: yes
[2013-09-25 20:21:01] Ahmed__: btw what does PR stands for? :D
[2013-09-25 20:21:09] lukeis: Pull Request

[2013-09-25 20:22:47] Ahmed__: dumb* LOL

[2013-09-25 21:46:43] lukeis: Ahmed__: let me know when you update InstalledAndroidApp.java in that requestâ€¦ that's what I was waiting for ;)
[2013-09-25 21:46:58] Ahmed__: it's updated
