[2013-11-20 11:07:35] MiSter: hi selendroid community
[2013-11-20 11:08:07] MiSter: I am new to selendroid and have some problems I need to discuss. I hope this is the right place for that
[2013-11-20 11:17:05] ddary: Hi MiSter
[2013-11-20 11:17:19] ddary: exactly, that here is the right place
[2013-11-20 11:17:21] ddary: :)
[2013-11-20 11:17:37] MiSter: fine. so let's start
[2013-11-20 11:19:17] MiSter: i am using selendroid inside appium which is not a problem (anymore). the app i am trying to test has "buttons" which are actually subclasses of  TextView. selendroid finds them but click() hangs and after 60s breaks with timeout. Any ideas?
[2013-11-20 11:21:29] MiSter: Using TouchActions singleTap returns immediately and the console shows a response of status 0 but no tap performed
[2013-11-20 11:22:12] ddary: are the buttons visible or maybe hidden by a keyboard?
[2013-11-20 11:23:19] MiSter: everything is visible, no keyboard displayed. using appium (without selendroid) click() works as expected
[2013-11-20 11:25:50] ddary: Have you tried just to use the click method on the WebElement?
[2013-11-20 11:26:45] MiSter: this was try number 1. el = findElement(By.id -> el.click()
[2013-11-20 11:27:09] MiSter: and el is the correct element after findElement
[2013-11-20 11:27:47] ddary: and that was also not working?
[2013-11-20 11:28:09] MiSter: nope. this results in a hang in click and the 60s timeout
[2013-11-20 11:30:08] ddary: if you invoke: el.isDisplayed(), what does it return?
[2013-11-20 11:30:13] MiSter: just tried it again. the log shows the http /element/<id>/click request, then nothing and 60s later: Didn't get a new command in 60 secs, shutting down
[2013-11-20 11:32:26] ddary: isDisplayed()?
[2013-11-20 11:32:35] MiSter: just testing
[2013-11-20 11:32:39] ddary: ok, sorry
[2013-11-20 11:34:22] MiSter: it is false. very interesting. as i said before using the same code with pure appium el.click() works.
