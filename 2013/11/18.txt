[2013-11-18 13:05:19] smiklosovic: ddary: hi, could you please tell me what should i do with this one? i have a simple activty with text views, name + email + pass + pass repeat and below all of this there is a (registration) button. So when I .sendKeys on these elements, registration button is not visible, it is covered by keyboard. When i am about to click on that registration button, it says that it can not found that element ...
[2013-11-18 13:20:50] smiklosovic: ddary: i am trying to figure out how to hide that keyboard after i fill the last text view however nothing seems to work, I tried Actions action = new Actions(driver); action.sendKeys(Keys.ESCAPE); as well as Keys.ENTER but it does not work, on emulator, pressing escape hides it ...

[2013-11-18 13:33:06] ddary: smiklosovic: you mean the button is not visible because the keyboard is hiding the button?
[2013-11-18 13:33:17] smiklosovic: ddary: exactly
[2013-11-18 13:33:48] ddary: smiklosovic: if you use the
[2013-11-18 13:34:16] ddary: advanced gestures to swipe a bit, does this help?
[2013-11-18 13:35:23] smiklosovic: i have not try that yet ...
[2013-11-18 13:35:56] smiklosovic: i am trying just to hide that with emulation the pressing of some button
[2013-11-18 13:36:18] smiklosovic: like driver.getKeyboard().sendKeys(Keys.ESCAPE) or similar
[2013-11-18 13:37:24] ddary: I don't know a way (which means I have not looked into it) about how to remove the keyboard
[2013-11-18 13:38:09] smiklosovic: ok, i'll let you know when I find the way, thansk
[2013-11-18 13:38:12] smiklosovic: *thanks
[2013-11-18 13:38:43] ddary: I will also look around, if I find something
