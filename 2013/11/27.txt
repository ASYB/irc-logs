[2013-11-27 18:06:13] lukeis: yes
[2013-11-27 18:06:17] ddary: no

[2013-11-27 18:06:43] mummana: evevry time whn emultor launch i get an error msg as launch isnt responding? can i know wt might be th problem'?
[2013-11-27 18:06:51] ddary: sadly busy with other stuff
[2013-11-27 18:08:41] ddary: what is the exact error message?
[2013-11-27 18:09:09] mummana:  launch isnt responding?
[2013-11-27 18:09:27] mummana: whenever the emultor gets launch
[2013-11-27 18:11:36] mummana: if i start the emulator manually then im not getting that
[2013-11-27 18:11:44] mummana: error
[2013-11-27 18:11:57] lukeis: mummana: add the -verbose flag to the selendroid command line when you start it and then :gist the whole output
[2013-11-27 18:12:15] mummana: sure
[2013-11-27 18:12:23] lukeis: the emulator never starts up?
[2013-11-27 18:13:12] mummana: it start but with an error launch isnt responding?
[2013-11-27 18:13:36] mummana: shall i mail uh the snapshot of it?
[2013-11-27 18:13:48] lukeis: pasting it in a :gist will do :)
[2013-11-27 18:14:57] mummana: well ok but i start my server with server.start i dnt use commnad line for that ? then how to make gist?
[2013-11-27 18:15:20] lukeis: you should be getting output from it though, right?
[2013-11-27 18:15:44] lukeis: click the link to gist.github and paste it in there then copy the url of the created gist
[2013-11-27 18:16:09] mummana: config.setVerbose(true); will this will be working?
[2013-11-27 18:16:16] operatiay, joining. (#selendroid)
[2013-11-27 18:16:24] lukeis: should
[2013-11-27 18:16:37] mummana: ok tha wait
[2013-11-27 18:17:56] lukeis: will probably be good to know what emulator config(s) you have. for example I know that using API Level 19 with snapshot  will not work right now (at least doesn't for me)
