[2013-10-11 07:42:41] ddary: in the interactive python shell I use mostly
[2013-10-11 07:42:52] ddary: from selenium import webdriver;

[2013-10-11 08:01:13] mummana: https://gist.github.com/mummana/6930195

[2013-10-11 08:09:00] ddary: can you see something in the console of the standalone server?
[2013-10-11 08:09:26] ddary: you need to start it first manually
[2013-10-11 08:11:29] mummana: i did same as in java

[2013-10-11 08:14:58] ddary: if you cannot see any activity in the server shell, the python test is doing something wrong
[2013-10-11 08:17:37] mummana: can uh please look at my code once please???
[2013-10-11 08:20:08] ddary: I don't see there an error
