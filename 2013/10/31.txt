[2013-10-31 21:13:35] ddary: welcome Android API 19 :-)
[2013-10-31 21:18:19] lukeis: why hello there 19...
[2013-10-31 21:18:56] lukeis: i wonder where aapt will get moved to this time ;)
[2013-10-31 21:19:02] ddary: lol
[2013-10-31 21:19:16] ddary: it is interesting how they move things around
[2013-10-31 21:19:56] ddary: will be interesting how webviews perform by being performed by chromium
[2013-10-31 21:20:13] lukeis: is that finally default?
[2013-10-31 21:20:34] *lukeis needs to read the release log'
[2013-10-31 21:20:50] ddary: http://developer.android.com/guide/webapps/migrating.html
[2013-10-31 21:21:03] ddary: you were right :-)
[2013-10-31 21:21:28] lukeis: well that's good :)
[2013-10-31 21:21:57] lukeis: chromedriver will hopefully solve some of my issues in the webview area
[2013-10-31 21:22:13] lukeis: but of course not for anything <19 ;)
[2013-10-31 21:22:46] ddary: yeah, i know
[2013-10-31 21:23:00] ddary: i currently also experiment with ui automator
[2013-10-31 21:23:25] ddary: do you know anything when bully will be opensourced?
[2013-10-31 21:27:11] lukeis: no, i don'tâ€¦ i'll ping simon again when i see him online next
[2013-10-31 21:27:56] lukeis: ddary: or we can start expanding selendroid to use it ;)
[2013-10-31 21:28:20] ddary: exactly
